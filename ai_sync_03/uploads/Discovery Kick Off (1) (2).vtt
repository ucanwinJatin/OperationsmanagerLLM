e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/22-0
00:00:04.134 --> 00:00:04.424
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/92-0
00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:07.737
So, David, how would you want to
run this like you know can we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/92-1
00:00:07.737 --> 00:00:10.831
can start by sharing the use
case story that we got and we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/92-2
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.186
could walk if that's that's the
that's the way that you want to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/52-0
00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:12.174
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/92-3
00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:17.227
go through we'll we'll be happy
to do that or do you have

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/92-4
00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:20.426
anything any other inputs from
that standpoint as to how you

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/92-5
00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:21.894
want to start the discovery.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/93-0
00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:23.454
No, no.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/113-0
00:00:23.464 --> 00:00:26.705
I think going from the use case
we've sent you, you know, part

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/113-1
00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:29.124
especially with with
transparency in coverage.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/115-0
00:00:29.134 --> 00:00:30.024
You're what?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/136-0
00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:32.656
You're not going to have is a
whole bunch of folks on our side

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/136-1
00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:34.154
that have thought through this
one.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/142-0
00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.704
Umm uh.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/149-0
00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:40.204
It's uhm, you know one SEC.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/167-0
00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:52.944
Uh, it's an unfamiliar area for
a lot of us as well.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/192-0
00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:56.329
You know, I think between myself
and Dave, Schweppe will probably

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/192-1
00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.204
doing be doing some discovery
with you in real time on it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/196-0
00:00:59.224 --> 00:00:59.994
Sure, sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/201-0
00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:01.284
Umm, it was.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/209-0
00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:05.244
It was an interesting one for
us.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/228-0
00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:08.359
Just because it is kind of a new
and novel data set that would

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/228-1
00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.444
push the organization.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/264-0
00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:12.928
So with that, you may also be
getting a little bit less

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/264-1
00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:16.712
specific expertise on this one
compared to the one we've got

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/264-2
00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:20.185
tomorrow around you know
customer specific data that we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/264-3
00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:21.054
wanna feed in.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/269-0
00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:24.664
Got got it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/275-0
00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:25.444
Got it. David.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/280-0
00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:26.124
So would it?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/323-0
00:01:26.134 --> 00:01:28.823
Would it make sense if we walk
through the user story that we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/323-1
00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:31.598
received and and get your inputs
and I'll I'll present the user

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/311-0
00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:30.494
Sure. Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/323-2
00:01:31.598 --> 00:01:34.244
story and then we could probably
take it forward from there.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/336-0
00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:35.054
Would that make sense to you?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/333-0
00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:35.604
Sounds good.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/344-0
00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:36.414
Yeah, absolutely.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/338-0
00:01:36.414 --> 00:01:36.724
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/346-0
00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:37.964
Let me just present it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/366-0
00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:41.078
I'll just go off camera just so
that like I'm presenting, so I

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/366-1
00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:42.654
wouldn't know any who is talking
so.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/374-0
00:01:48.744 --> 00:01:49.824
It's my screen visible.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/376-0
00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:51.264
This is, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/379-0
00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:55.334
OK, sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/384-0
00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:56.964
So David, over to you.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/389-0
00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:01.744
Uh umm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/395-0
00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:03.064
So do you mean?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/408-0
00:02:03.074 --> 00:02:06.224
I mean, make sure I'm clear as
to what the expectation is.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/413-0
00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:07.144
We read through this.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/448-0
00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:10.534
Or are there certain areas that
three year uh.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/426-0
00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:08.614
No, no, no, sorry.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/429-0
00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:09.194
It's my.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/433-0
00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:09.614
My bad.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/439-0
00:02:09.624 --> 00:02:09.974
Now I'll.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/442-0
00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:10.664
I'll set the agenda.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/464-0
00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:13.533
So basically what we did was we
understood the requirements,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/464-1
00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:13.814
David.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/485-0
00:02:13.824 --> 00:02:18.175
And you know what we have done
is we have started exploring the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/485-1
00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:22.526
three datasets that were given
to us, the HHC and UHC data set,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/480-0
00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:19.074
Yep.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/485-2
00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:22.934
right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/503-0
00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:25.991
And then we based on this, we
understand we started looking at

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/503-1
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:26.734
the data schema.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/538-0
00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:30.102
We understood to certain extent
what each data schema is, so I I

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/538-1
00:02:30.102 --> 00:02:33.253
do understand that as part of
the discovery exercise, we may

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/538-2
00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:35.784
not be able to cover every
single aspect of this

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/538-3
00:02:35.784 --> 00:02:36.404
requirement.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/580-0
00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:40.916
But what I wanted to understand
was, you know from the the files

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/580-1
00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:44.784
that we have seen like for
example HCSC was a large file

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/580-2
00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:48.653
and we were able to fairly
understand certain aspects of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/580-3
00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:49.264
the file.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/609-0
00:02:49.354 --> 00:02:54.544
But you would see file in itself
has nearly about 780 to 800 in

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/609-1
00:02:54.544 --> 00:02:59.004
different file data types or
file data schemas, right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/686-0
00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:02.428
So what we also wanted to
understand was if we can get

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/686-1
00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:06.232
certain guidance from you in
terms of what does this UHC file

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/686-2
00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:09.790
have and and probably what are
some of the different data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/686-3
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.717
schemas that we could get some
advice on that was one aspect of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/686-4
00:03:13.717 --> 00:03:17.398
it, but I I do understand that
you you've already mentioned

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/686-5
00:03:17.398 --> 00:03:20.404
that this is also a fairly new
use case for you.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/692-0
00:03:20.564 --> 00:03:22.254
So I I would be happy to.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/694-0
00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:20.904
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/696-0
00:03:22.544 --> 00:03:22.974
We can.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/724-0
00:03:22.984 --> 00:03:27.192
We can do one thing right, like
if this is a, this is a is a use

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/724-1
00:03:27.192 --> 00:03:30.494
case that we probably have to Co
explore our code.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/734-0
00:03:30.504 --> 00:03:33.394
Discover that that we can do it
together, right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/779-0
00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:36.452
But if for today's session, if
you want today's session to be

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/779-1
00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:39.241
more focusing on the other use
case, the patient satisfaction

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/779-2
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:41.670
use case which you are
comfortable with, we can start

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/779-3
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.694
with that also David, if that
works for you.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/789-0
00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:47.494
Uh, yeah, that's fine.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/786-0
00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:49.214
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/832-0
00:03:49.264 --> 00:03:52.517
I mean I I mean what we could do
is then for tomorrow we can use

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/832-1
00:03:52.517 --> 00:03:55.620
this particular use case so that
we can also show you what we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/832-2
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.623
have understood as part of the
data schema and we can share

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/832-3
00:03:58.623 --> 00:03:59.074
with you.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/855-0
00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:01.728
But for today, if you want to,
you want to start with the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/855-1
00:04:01.728 --> 00:04:04.513
patient satisfaction use case,
that will be that will be great,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/855-2
00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:04.774
David.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/864-0
00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.244
Well, for the patient's, OK, so
for the.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/882-0
00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:16.953
Alright, so I I'm sorry I maybe
I misinterpreted what you were

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/882-1
00:04:16.953 --> 00:04:17.334
saying.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/903-0
00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:19.544
So are we suggesting we flip
these two sessions?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/896-0
00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:20.774
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/901-0
00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:21.254
Yes, David.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/963-0
00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:24.889
So that was one one thought
because because I think what

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/963-1
00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.895
what I am also getting as a as
an insight is you know this UHC

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/963-2
00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:32.774
use case, the user story. We
have understood the user story.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/974-0
00:04:32.904 --> 00:04:35.681
But we also wanted to know if
there is anything that you can

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/974-1
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:38.549
provide us as guidance in you
know in terms of direction, what

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/974-2
00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:39.414
should we be doing?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1000-0
00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:43.285
Because what we felt was
understanding the data schema is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1000-1
00:04:43.285 --> 00:04:46.614
1 but being able to get what is
an outcome right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1011-0
00:04:46.624 --> 00:04:48.834
Like what are some of the
dashboards that you want?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1023-0
00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.714
How would you want the plans to
be compared?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1050-0
00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:54.996
What could be the what could be
the type of different types of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1050-1
00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:58.162
charts that you might be looking
in terms of price plan

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1050-2
00:04:58.162 --> 00:04:58.784
comparison?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1072-0
00:04:58.974 --> 00:05:01.536
Those are some of the insights
that we kind of wanted as part

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1072-1
00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:03.024
of the discovery for this use
case.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1099-0
00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:08.104
But if you feel that we should
take sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1081-0
00:05:06.034 --> 00:05:06.304
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1091-0
00:05:06.314 --> 00:05:07.984
So with the, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1130-0
00:05:07.994 --> 00:05:11.956
So with that and then we can and
and part of the the SOW we sent

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1130-1
00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:15.858
over had had some of that around
what are some of the analytics

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1130-2
00:05:15.858 --> 00:05:17.504
we wanna do on top of this?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1143-0
00:05:17.514 --> 00:05:19.154
I don't know if that made its
way.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1138-0
00:05:18.314 --> 00:05:18.904
Right, yes.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1146-0
00:05:21.134 --> 00:05:21.424
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1148-0
00:05:21.424 --> 00:05:21.714
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1150-0
00:05:21.434 --> 00:05:21.904
Playing better?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1158-0
00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:25.104
So Babu, yeah, so we we did.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1164-0
00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:24.244
Yeah, go ahead.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1166-0
00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:25.944
We did look at it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1175-0
00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:29.034
We created certain mock mock
screens around it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1178-0
00:05:29.044 --> 00:05:29.534
David, right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1187-0
00:05:29.544 --> 00:05:31.384
Like uh, so we will probably
share.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1238-0
00:05:31.394 --> 00:05:35.034
We have already shared that with
as part of the proposal, but

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1238-1
00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:38.264
what we also wanted to
understand was, as part of this

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1238-2
00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:41.787
is, is this exactly what you
want or is there anything else

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1238-3
00:05:41.787 --> 00:05:44.958
that you want to probably
explore is what I wanted to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1238-4
00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:45.604
understand.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1261-0
00:05:45.614 --> 00:05:48.694
We wanted to understand as well,
David, sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1276-0
00:05:46.374 --> 00:05:49.511
So here's here's what I would
say is these these analytic

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1276-1
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:52.864
insights here below are kind of
think of him as a first pass.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1297-0
00:05:52.874 --> 00:05:56.249
Got check that we have an
underlying data asset on top of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1294-0
00:05:55.924 --> 00:05:56.174
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1297-1
00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:57.704
which I can do analytics.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1348-0
00:05:58.034 --> 00:06:01.872
So yes, there probably is going
to be more use cases after this,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1309-0
00:05:58.084 --> 00:05:58.344
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1348-1
00:06:01.872 --> 00:06:05.532
but I did at the end of the day
the the goal of engaging with

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1348-2
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:09.311
you guys on this one isn't for
the endless number of dashboards

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1348-3
00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:10.374
we can put on top.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1356-0
00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:12.144
It really is an understanding.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1371-0
00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:15.474
How do we take disparate data
sets and normalize them into a

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1371-1
00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:16.454
usable data model?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1374-0
00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:17.474
That's the.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1383-0
00:06:17.484 --> 00:06:18.454
That's the sticky wicket.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1384-0
00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:20.074
OK, got it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1387-0
00:06:20.274 --> 00:06:21.524
OK, fine.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1400-0
00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:25.594
So so there are two ways to go
through this, David.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1433-0
00:06:25.604 --> 00:06:28.734
One is we can share what we have
understood so far on the data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1433-1
00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:31.616
sets and then come out with
certain questions and then we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1433-2
00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:33.654
can walk through those
questions, right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1473-0
00:06:33.664 --> 00:06:37.797
So that is one approach,
particularly that that was one

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1444-0
00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:35.404
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1473-1
00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:42.594
thing that we wanted to discuss
because like we found the HC use

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1473-2
00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:47.244
case was pretty HCSC files were
pretty straightforward for us.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1499-0
00:06:47.254 --> 00:06:51.417
But the UHC files had various
different combinations, various

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1499-1
00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:55.514
different data schemas, then one
you know in in one data set

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1499-2
00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:55.984
itself.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1555-0
00:06:56.054 --> 00:06:59.214
So we wanted to probably
understand if you want all of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1555-1
00:06:59.214 --> 00:07:02.374
those data schemas to be
implemented or pulled in into

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1555-2
00:07:02.374 --> 00:07:05.936
the data platform, or can we,
for the purpose of the POC, can

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1555-3
00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:09.383
we add only certain file types
and if so, what would be the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1555-4
00:07:09.383 --> 00:07:11.854
file types that you are looking
at, right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1603-0
00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:15.108
So those were some questions
that we had, maybe these are not

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1603-1
00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:18.300
for discovery, this could be for
design session as well, but

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1589-0
00:07:17.754 --> 00:07:17.954
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1603-2
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.544
wanted to understand if you had
some thoughts on that, right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1685-0
00:07:21.554 --> 00:07:25.047
So, but that was the reason,
maybe one another way that we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1685-1
00:07:25.047 --> 00:07:28.599
can do is between today and
tomorrow we could actually come

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1685-2
00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:32.092
out with various different
questions on each of these file

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1685-3
00:07:32.092 --> 00:07:35.525
types and then we can go over
those questions with you in

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1685-4
00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:38.781
tomorrow's session if you want
to flip the sessions to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1656-0
00:07:37.754 --> 00:07:38.344
Yeah, that's fine.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1669-0
00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:40.164
We we can probably probably do
that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1685-5
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:40.084
tomorrow, right? Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1678-0
00:07:40.174 --> 00:07:41.334
We've got Dave Wolfe on now.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1688-0
00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:42.794
Who'd be critical for the other
one, I'd say.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1702-0
00:07:48.824 --> 00:07:51.834
Ah ohh course.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1698-0
00:07:52.214 --> 00:07:52.644
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1703-0
00:07:52.654 --> 00:07:53.904
So this is dish, Webby.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1708-0
00:07:53.914 --> 00:07:54.714
I'm sorry I'm late.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1723-0
00:07:55.194 --> 00:07:57.184
I've got a contractor tearing my
kitchen apart.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1722-0
00:07:56.464 --> 00:07:56.784
Active.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1751-0
00:07:57.834 --> 00:08:02.286
I'm so I'm kind of stepping this
too, but on the tick files are

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1751-1
00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:05.973
really kind of market market
standard files that are

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1751-2
00:08:05.973 --> 00:08:07.434
available now, right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1767-0
00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:09.826
So you're gonna find their
formats are gonna be a little

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1767-1
00:08:09.826 --> 00:08:10.244
different.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1789-0
00:08:10.254 --> 00:08:15.691
I think from file to file I'm
not sure if the HCSC file in the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1789-1
00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:17.504
use case is our spec.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1812-0
00:08:18.404 --> 00:08:22.734
What do you think about the use
cases that are there for, uh,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1812-1
00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:26.994
comparison of data you know by
cost you realization quality.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1828-0
00:08:27.484 --> 00:08:34.865
The intent would be in my mind
to create a set of data that is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1828-1
00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:36.154
comparable.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1846-0
00:08:36.164 --> 00:08:41.932
Think about the TIF files as umm
side by side comparisons of our

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1846-1
00:08:41.932 --> 00:08:43.884
already existing data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1879-0
00:08:45.004 --> 00:08:49.361
So if I had an inpatient cost in
the tick file, I have an

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1856-0
00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:45.844
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1879-1
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:54.243
associate in patient cost in the
medeanalytics file in the lake,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1879-2
00:08:54.243 --> 00:08:54.694
right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1921-0
00:08:54.704 --> 00:08:58.434
So the concept would be to
create a bridge between those

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1921-1
00:08:58.434 --> 00:09:02.426
two and one of the challenges I
think you're gonna run into,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1921-2
00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:06.614
although I'm not so much of what
I've read and what I've heard.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1923-0
00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:07.674
I'm not.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1951-0
00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:11.878
Is that they're all being
created in their own schemas,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1951-1
00:09:11.878 --> 00:09:16.234
and so create that crosswalk and
then the same, and then that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1951-2
00:09:16.234 --> 00:09:18.974
crosswalk creating the same
hierarchy.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1956-0
00:09:19.424 --> 00:09:22.114
So provider facility.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1991-0
00:09:23.304 --> 00:09:27.581
Hey, you're whatever those
hierarchies are that attached

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1991-1
00:09:27.581 --> 00:09:32.308
that to that, that one cost or
that day of utilization or that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/1991-2
00:09:32.308 --> 00:09:35.384
that doctor's visit or et
cetera, right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2002-0
00:09:35.804 --> 00:09:40.444
So trying to create that bridge,
is that wolf in Bartley?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2007-0
00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:41.754
What you're thinking here?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2013-0
00:09:43.434 --> 00:09:45.164
Uh, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2075-0
00:09:45.174 --> 00:09:49.091
I mean, I so said differently
because I use different words is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2075-1
00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:52.945
recognizing that and that part
of the way this is at the core

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2075-2
00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:56.800
of why tick is a problem that
we're trying to solve for is if

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2075-3
00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.903
you look at HCSC, UHC and Signa,
they're all by design gonna make

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2075-4
00:10:00.903 --> 00:10:03.204
their data as different as
possible.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2094-0
00:10:03.264 --> 00:10:08.888
And so can we land these and
normalize them such they become

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2094-1
00:10:08.888 --> 00:10:10.824
uniformly analyzable?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2130-0
00:10:11.054 --> 00:10:15.490
It's not the right word, but you
know, can we structure them into

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2114-0
00:10:13.024 --> 00:10:13.864
And comparable.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2130-1
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.523
a consistent data model knowing
that they come from various

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2130-2
00:10:19.523 --> 00:10:22.414
disparate intentionally
disparate formats?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2125-0
00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:20.384
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2141-0
00:10:23.364 --> 00:10:27.514
Yes, that that, yes, we both did
the same thing.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2151-0
00:10:27.864 --> 00:10:30.074
OK, we'll same page, OK and.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2150-0
00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:29.374
Yeah, OK. Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2166-0
00:10:33.124 --> 00:10:35.284
Do you guys have an outlay of
one of our?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2181-0
00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:38.584
Data schemas.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2174-0
00:10:38.614 --> 00:10:38.984
Do you?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2201-0
00:10:39.114 --> 00:10:42.040
Do you live one of our data
schemas, Mike, that we could

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2187-0
00:10:39.724 --> 00:10:39.954
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2201-1
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.274
provide or or Anthony for them,
see how we structure our data?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2207-0
00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:46.234
Is that a possibility?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2228-0
00:10:48.304 --> 00:10:51.031
Or is that because I know our
schemas are a little emitted

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2228-1
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:53.204
create a little different than
the real world?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2230-0
00:10:55.044 --> 00:10:55.234
Hello.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2235-0
00:10:56.224 --> 00:10:56.464
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2244-0
00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.564
We don't. We don't have it yet,
David.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2250-0
00:10:58.354 --> 00:10:58.584
Sorry.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2263-0
00:10:59.574 --> 00:11:01.750
But if you could share that will
be great as well because that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2263-1
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.544
will give us some idea.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2286-0
00:11:03.334 --> 00:11:06.225
I mean the points that you
mentioned about UHC and Cigna

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2286-1
00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:08.964
was exactly what we also found
in our basic analysis.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2303-0
00:11:09.334 --> 00:11:13.669
We found, you know, they are not
just disparate data, but they

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2303-1
00:11:13.669 --> 00:11:15.734
are also of disparate schemas.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2338-0
00:11:15.944 --> 00:11:18.867
So we are trying to bring them
into one, you know, one

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2338-1
00:11:18.867 --> 00:11:21.470
standardized format or
normalized format that is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2338-2
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.234
something that you know, we also
wanted to work on.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2353-0
00:11:24.364 --> 00:11:27.700
And you know, one of the other
aspects in Azure, please correct

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2353-1
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.534
me if I'm wrong.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2391-0
00:11:28.664 --> 00:11:32.306
What we found us within the UHC
set of files there are 780

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2391-1
00:11:32.306 --> 00:11:36.257
different types of schema that
we that that we saw 780 could be

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2393-0
00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:36.154
Of course there are.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2391-2
00:11:36.257 --> 00:11:36.874
arbitrary.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2394-0
00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:37.534
Sorry yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2412-0
00:11:39.094 --> 00:11:43.191
I'm just laughing because the
law requires that they provide

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2412-1
00:11:43.191 --> 00:11:45.274
the data, not explain the data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2416-0
00:11:48.224 --> 00:11:48.404
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2415-0
00:11:48.404 --> 00:11:48.564
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2423-0
00:11:52.764 --> 00:11:54.354
Yeah, that that got it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2426-0
00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:54.994
Got it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2430-0
00:11:55.064 --> 00:11:55.814
So what?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2474-0
00:11:56.124 --> 00:11:59.555
What we were trying to find out
was we were trying to find out

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2474-1
00:11:59.555 --> 00:12:02.658
if, for the purposes of the
proof of concept, if we, you

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2474-2
00:12:02.658 --> 00:12:06.144
know, what could be the scope of
this one is obviously creating

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2474-3
00:12:06.144 --> 00:12:07.124
the data platform.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2531-0
00:12:07.304 --> 00:12:10.985
Another is when we take the UNC
file itself, should we focus on

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2531-1
00:12:10.985 --> 00:12:14.723
all 780 files to be standardized
or can we take a group of them,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2531-2
00:12:14.723 --> 00:12:18.231
cluster them at least for the
purpose of puoc because we are

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2531-3
00:12:18.231 --> 00:12:20.474
we have a time bound POC cluster
them.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2537-0
00:12:20.484 --> 00:12:21.964
Let's say we take hundred
different files.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2574-0
00:12:22.704 --> 00:12:27.455
OK, group them, normalize them
and then you know, use that as a

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2574-1
00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:31.464
places for, you know, building
larger normalizations.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2564-0
00:12:31.814 --> 00:12:32.144
I do.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2600-0
00:12:32.154 --> 00:12:35.595
I do think it's acceptable that
we take a subset and for the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2585-0
00:12:35.044 --> 00:12:35.214
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2600-1
00:12:35.595 --> 00:12:38.867
purposes of 1, just just
validating that we can get these

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2600-2
00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:41.124
disparate formats into a single
schema.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2607-0
00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.364
It may create doofus.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2617-0
00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:45.484
I'm thinking about, you know,
future use cases.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2632-0
00:12:45.494 --> 00:12:49.084
We have around AI, I think not
for the scope of this.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2652-0
00:12:49.094 --> 00:12:52.312
So again, to your point of let's
lock down the scope, there may

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2652-1
00:12:52.312 --> 00:12:54.274
be some future use case on the
use of.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2667-0
00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:58.689
AI for mapping of these
disparate data sets into a

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2667-1
00:12:58.689 --> 00:12:59.874
single schema.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2688-0
00:13:00.374 --> 00:13:03.430
Uh, but I don't know that we
need to do the the full set of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2688-1
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.634
UHC.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2690-0
00:13:04.644 --> 00:13:08.244
UM it ideally.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2720-0
00:13:09.474 --> 00:13:13.264
Between the three, if we want to
narrow the scope of what's in

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2720-1
00:13:13.264 --> 00:13:16.814
the files, we would take these
three sources and look for.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2735-0
00:13:17.834 --> 00:13:21.974
Uh, common geographies that
exist in all three and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2735-1
00:13:21.974 --> 00:13:23.354
prioritize those.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2741-0
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:26.094
Got it. OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2742-0
00:13:26.654 --> 00:13:26.924
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2746-0
00:13:26.934 --> 00:13:29.314
One quick question, David and
yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2752-0
00:13:31.184 --> 00:13:31.664
Free free.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2758-0
00:13:31.674 --> 00:13:32.274
Look at this.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2765-0
00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:33.894
This just talk particular
document.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2785-0
00:13:33.904 --> 00:13:38.944
I think the MRF field or
required data elements is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2785-1
00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:43.094
listed, so do we think this list
is good?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2813-0
00:13:43.104 --> 00:13:48.108
Good to start with in terms of
making sure these columns are

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2813-1
00:13:48.108 --> 00:13:52.374
are extracted or or or or or
modeled in our system.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2825-0
00:13:52.384 --> 00:13:55.894
That will get get the maximum
use cases covered.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2860-0
00:13:56.064 --> 00:14:00.765
Since this is a file, that is
something that we have, we we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2860-1
00:14:00.765 --> 00:14:05.937
try to map them with the you you
HCSC on the UHC file formats and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2860-2
00:14:05.937 --> 00:14:07.504
we were able to map.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2902-0
00:14:07.654 --> 00:14:11.589
I won't say 100%, but I can say
to to our knowledge we were able

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2902-1
00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:15.221
to map out at least 80 plus
percentage of of the columns we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2902-2
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.824
were able to map from the those
two files.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2934-0
00:14:17.934 --> 00:14:21.970
So, David, do you think this
list of 18 columns should cover

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2934-1
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.138
most of the use cases or do you
think like you mentioned about

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2934-2
00:14:26.138 --> 00:14:27.064
the geography?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2942-0
00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:29.064
I think the the ZIP code is
available here.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2962-0
00:14:29.074 --> 00:14:33.038
So similar to that, do you do
you think any any any other

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2953-0
00:14:29.694 --> 00:14:29.944
Umm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2962-1
00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:34.884
columns will be of helpful?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2978-0
00:14:38.784 --> 00:14:41.188
Specifically, anything outside
the purview of these 18 columns,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2978-1
00:14:41.188 --> 00:14:41.414
right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2990-0
00:14:41.424 --> 00:14:42.484
Ashok, if I understand you
right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2986-0
00:14:41.664 --> 00:14:42.194
Yeah, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/2991-0
00:14:42.204 --> 00:14:43.174
Yeah, exactly. Yes.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3000-0
00:14:45.924 --> 00:14:47.484
So I'm I'm I'm going through.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3012-0
00:14:50.134 --> 00:14:53.744
I'll, I'll comment and the kid.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3024-0
00:14:53.754 --> 00:14:58.964
I'm just reviewing this just now
so this is high level.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3044-0
00:14:59.074 --> 00:15:03.860
This will get us at the highest
level of acclaim or the provider

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3044-1
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.554
level claim at the MPI.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3065-0
00:15:05.924 --> 00:15:09.355
It won't provide data Dave at
the at the at the at the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3065-1
00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:11.664
procedure level or diagnostic
level.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3081-0
00:15:12.924 --> 00:15:16.353
So the whole thing about the
tick files is it's cost per

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3081-1
00:15:16.353 --> 00:15:16.654
care.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3107-0
00:15:17.654 --> 00:15:21.356
I think some of the TIF Files Go
down the procedure level, so

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3107-1
00:15:21.356 --> 00:15:23.744
you're trying to compare cost
per cost.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3109-0
00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:25.214
CD4.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3111-0
00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:26.704
Umm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3119-0
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:28.424
Or I see you not 10.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3134-0
00:15:28.534 --> 00:15:30.934
You're not gonna be able to do
that with this outlet.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3149-0
00:15:32.384 --> 00:15:36.896
But sweat, he doesn't line 14
that the billing code provides

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3148-0
00:15:36.054 --> 00:15:36.584
Yeah, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3149-1
00:15:36.896 --> 00:15:37.784
get to that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3153-0
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:41.174
I'm sorry.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3176-0
00:15:41.184 --> 00:15:42.774
Yeah, 14 is the type of billing.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3166-0
00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:43.144
Oh, I'm sorry.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3172-0
00:15:43.154 --> 00:15:43.784
Yeah, you're right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3178-0
00:15:43.794 --> 00:15:44.604
I'm sorry, Dave.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3182-0
00:15:44.474 --> 00:15:44.614
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3191-0
00:15:45.114 --> 00:15:47.954
My my I missed, I missed that I
was looking.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3204-0
00:15:48.014 --> 00:15:49.224
I was reading the one above it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3213-0
00:15:49.634 --> 00:15:50.364
OK, got it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3215-0
00:15:49.704 --> 00:15:50.274
That's all right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3236-0
00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:52.256
I started from the bottom
figuring everyone would start

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3227-0
00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:51.014
You don't know?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3236-1
00:15:52.256 --> 00:15:52.714
from the top.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3233-0
00:15:53.354 --> 00:15:54.124
Yeah, that's OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3239-0
00:15:54.174 --> 00:15:54.654
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3254-0
00:15:54.444 --> 00:15:55.064
We'll meet in the middle.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3250-0
00:15:54.664 --> 00:15:56.004
No, that that fall OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3256-0
00:15:56.234 --> 00:15:57.214
I take back what I said.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3274-0
00:16:00.144 --> 00:16:01.064
Yeah, I.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3270-0
00:16:00.454 --> 00:16:02.424
Do we have a sense of of all the
data?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3292-0
00:16:02.434 --> 00:16:05.432
Like what is the highest value
you know you're gonna be

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3292-1
00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:06.824
narrowing scope for a POC.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3296-0
00:16:07.114 --> 00:16:08.004
Do we again?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3299-0
00:16:08.014 --> 00:16:08.164
I'm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3301-0
00:16:08.174 --> 00:16:08.624
I'm coming.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3341-0
00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:12.164
I'm coming in a little bit new
to this as well, but like if we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3341-1
00:16:12.164 --> 00:16:15.806
could pick three, three or four,
do we know which one will drive

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3341-2
00:16:15.806 --> 00:16:18.104
the most value to us or to a
client yet?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3354-0
00:16:18.114 --> 00:16:21.644
Or is that require some some
digging in just?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3364-0
00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.324
I think that's a natural way to
kind of limit.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3368-0
00:16:24.334 --> 00:16:25.004
It is just call.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3393-0
00:16:25.014 --> 00:16:27.696
Let's go for the highest, most
valuable data to begin with, and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3393-1
00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.834
then we could always keep
peeling off more layers.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3412-0
00:16:33.954 --> 00:16:39.922
I, Mike, I don't think that
that's I'm contemplate what

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3412-1
00:16:39.922 --> 00:16:41.414
you're saying.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3440-0
00:16:42.354 --> 00:16:46.731
I think if we wanna do this and
really see value in it, we need

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3440-1
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:49.604
to have it at the level that's
at row 14.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3469-0
00:16:50.464 --> 00:16:55.445
14 Yeah, so, so I mean, the way
I look at it would be, yeah,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3482-0
00:16:52.794 --> 00:16:56.750
Because then cause then we can
summarize up, because what's

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3469-1
00:16:55.445 --> 00:16:55.854
yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3482-1
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.244
built into one through 18 here
is implied hierarchy.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3510-0
00:17:01.294 --> 00:17:04.041
And so if we're gonna create a
decision that you're making, we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3494-0
00:17:01.434 --> 00:17:01.674
Right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3510-1
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.134
have to decide what level of
hierarchy that is.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3524-0
00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:08.454
Yeah, his other, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3519-0
00:17:06.954 --> 00:17:09.584
And honestly, that's gonna be
hard.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3555-0
00:17:09.714 --> 00:17:16.349
In a claim with the spirit data
schemas from different plants or

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3543-0
00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:16.224
Mm-hmm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3555-1
00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:21.964
so, I like what you're saying,
the scope creep, but I.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3554-0
00:17:20.524 --> 00:17:21.094
The specific.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3578-0
00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:26.554
Anybody disagree with me and
wait?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3590-0
00:17:25.764 --> 00:17:28.792
This is also like I was gonna
say, I think we all agree 14

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3590-1
00:17:28.792 --> 00:17:30.384
gets us to that granular level.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3592-0
00:17:30.394 --> 00:17:31.374
And then what?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3602-0
00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.444
I'm not sure about is like is it
geography?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3624-0
00:17:33.454 --> 00:17:36.128
Like what are the two or three
other dimensions that give us

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3624-1
00:17:36.128 --> 00:17:38.584
the aha moment to say, yeah,
that's really interesting.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3672-0
00:17:38.674 --> 00:17:42.145
Look how different this is
across geography for the same

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3672-1
00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:45.860
billing code across these plans
and kind of jumping ahead to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3680-0
00:17:44.784 --> 00:17:46.983
I mean, I guess I guess you
could, you could say, well,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3672-2
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.834
like what, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3680-1
00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.417
let's just do it for Texas or
something, I guess you could do

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3680-2
00:17:49.417 --> 00:17:49.614
that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3682-0
00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:51.394
I'm is.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3700-0
00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:56.832
Is is the POC Bartley to
demonstrate the ability to do

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3700-1
00:17:56.832 --> 00:17:58.214
this or is it?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3740-0
00:17:58.284 --> 00:18:02.157
And then if we can do it, then
we expand it and add more data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3740-1
00:18:02.157 --> 00:18:05.717
to it as right now, because
right now you know, we don't

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3725-0
00:18:02.944 --> 00:18:03.764
That will that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3736-0
00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:04.544
Yeah, that's a.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3740-2
00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:06.654
have CVS, Edna.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3750-0
00:18:06.904 --> 00:18:10.514
We don't have elevons anthem.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3770-0
00:18:10.554 --> 00:18:14.114
You know, we don't have those
either, so umm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3759-0
00:18:13.264 --> 00:18:13.614
Correct.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3809-0
00:18:13.624 --> 00:18:17.328
At the moment, at the moment the
goal, the reason why I was

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3809-1
00:18:17.328 --> 00:18:20.847
suggesting we narrow the scope
to where we've got common

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3809-2
00:18:20.847 --> 00:18:24.674
geographies across all three
files is the ability to comingle

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3809-3
00:18:24.674 --> 00:18:28.440
datasets for the purposes of
creating an insight and if if I

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3809-4
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.304
have you know.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3857-0
00:18:30.004 --> 00:18:34.245
UHC data for California but
HCSC's data for Illinois and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3857-1
00:18:34.245 --> 00:18:36.254
Cigna data for Connecticut.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3873-0
00:18:36.544 --> 00:18:39.987
You know, we would prove out
umm, that we could land in

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3873-1
00:18:39.987 --> 00:18:43.738
normalize all three datasets,
but we wouldn't necessarily be

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3873-2
00:18:43.738 --> 00:18:47.427
able to see what the commingling
of those data sets does to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3873-3
00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:48.964
inform a single analysis.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3889-0
00:18:52.754 --> 00:18:53.034
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3896-0
00:18:52.804 --> 00:18:54.284
OK, so are we.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3883-0
00:18:53.774 --> 00:18:53.944
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3898-0
00:18:53.954 --> 00:18:56.944
The question I have is is do we
know who's the persona?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3905-0
00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:58.134
What's the problem?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3917-0
00:18:58.144 --> 00:19:01.105
They're trying to like like how
does this solve a problem for

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3917-1
00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:01.344
them?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3948-0
00:19:01.354 --> 00:19:05.275
Do we know that yet of like, who
is gonna have the aha moment to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3930-0
00:19:02.624 --> 00:19:03.134
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3942-0
00:19:03.144 --> 00:19:03.824
So yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3946-0
00:19:04.174 --> 00:19:04.914
So so.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3948-1
00:19:05.275 --> 00:19:07.024
say, wow, that's interesting.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3973-0
00:19:07.034 --> 00:19:09.264
Let me do something about that
or or take some action.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3961-0
00:19:08.524 --> 00:19:08.794
Right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3967-0
00:19:08.844 --> 00:19:09.434
So the.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4001-0
00:19:09.894 --> 00:19:14.622
So here's the the simple use
case on tick is I wanna look at

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/3980-0
00:19:10.364 --> 00:19:10.584
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4001-1
00:19:14.622 --> 00:19:18.886
where my network rates my
contracted rates compared to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4001-2
00:19:18.886 --> 00:19:20.514
others in the market.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4025-0
00:19:20.524 --> 00:19:25.352
So heat map for me by county
where I am 10% above the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4009-0
00:19:20.834 --> 00:19:20.994
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4025-1
00:19:25.352 --> 00:19:28.124
average, 10% below the average.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4029-0
00:19:28.754 --> 00:19:28.934
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4054-0
00:19:29.534 --> 00:19:33.976
How does my network rate
competitiveness compare to data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4054-1
00:19:33.976 --> 00:19:35.924
found in other Tik files?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4044-0
00:19:35.394 --> 00:19:35.924
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4046-0
00:19:35.964 --> 00:19:36.384
Perfect.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4155-0
00:19:36.394 --> 00:19:40.706
He's been I would say we just
take the 14 we, we take all the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4155-1
00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:45.018
common geographies slice it by
state county zip right and and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4155-2
00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:49.192
then we from there. We we, we
land, the data. Obviously, we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4155-3
00:19:49.192 --> 00:19:53.017
have a you know a kind of
pipeline that or whatever to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4155-4
00:19:53.017 --> 00:19:57.051
maybe at the table where we
unify you know the handful of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4155-5
00:19:57.051 --> 00:20:01.433
dimensions to allow that right
and then even better. If we can

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4155-6
00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:04.424
sort of correlate that to our to
our data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4225-0
00:20:04.484 --> 00:20:07.698
You know that we have and then
then we yeah, we come up with

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4225-1
00:20:07.698 --> 00:20:10.860
some dashboard views whether
it's Tableau, Powerbi with the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4225-2
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.970
maps and some tables and and
maybe some benchmarking to to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4225-3
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.237
establish the benchmark and yeah
just we we pick half a dozen

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4225-4
00:20:17.237 --> 00:20:19.714
dimensions that we could slice
it by you know.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4217-0
00:20:19.784 --> 00:20:20.094
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4226-0
00:20:20.104 --> 00:20:21.634
And so I we're looking at what?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4242-0
00:20:21.644 --> 00:20:25.001
What was originally put together
but within the SOW and we can

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4242-1
00:20:25.001 --> 00:20:25.694
pull that up.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4251-0
00:20:29.554 --> 00:20:32.234
Uh, sorry I wasn't born
document.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4255-0
00:20:32.284 --> 00:20:32.824
Give me a second.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4267-0
00:20:39.674 --> 00:20:42.224
Uh, that that was the analysis
we had.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4292-0
00:20:42.234 --> 00:20:45.885
We had prioritized in the SOW
just take like to get my hands

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4295-0
00:20:44.694 --> 00:20:46.664
OK. Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4292-1
00:20:45.885 --> 00:20:46.244
on it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4301-0
00:20:47.784 --> 00:20:49.684
But let me stop sharing David
and I'll probably.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4307-0
00:20:52.654 --> 00:20:52.884
Yes.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4314-0
00:20:52.894 --> 00:20:54.114
So it's going to be the billing.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4338-0
00:20:54.124 --> 00:20:57.951
Those billing codes are the 14
the provider ID's and then all

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4338-1
00:20:57.951 --> 00:21:01.594
the geographies different levels
as a as a starting point.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4346-0
00:21:01.604 --> 00:21:03.664
They may be a few other
dimensions too.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4361-0
00:21:03.724 --> 00:21:07.407
Is it get down to it's sort of
physician level, things like

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4361-1
00:21:07.407 --> 00:21:08.144
that too or?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4363-0
00:21:11.364 --> 00:21:11.564
Uh.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4380-0
00:21:13.114 --> 00:21:16.426
You know, I don't know if the
tick data would have specific

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4380-1
00:21:16.426 --> 00:21:17.144
provider MPI.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4383-0
00:21:17.154 --> 00:21:17.784
I think it does.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4429-0
00:21:22.144 --> 00:21:25.319
Because then we could see within
a county or whatever, you know,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4429-1
00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:28.250
it's sort of top five of the
highest cost, lowest cost, all

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4429-2
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.374
that kind of stuff too.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4431-0
00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.774
What theoretically you supposed
to be able to?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4446-0
00:21:38.304 --> 00:21:45.354
I compare charge masters by who
is doing the work.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4452-0
00:21:45.564 --> 00:21:46.504
Is the point of tick.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4453-0
00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:47.214
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4454-0
00:21:47.894 --> 00:21:48.244
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4457-0
00:21:48.254 --> 00:21:50.954
So UM.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4464-0
00:21:59.414 --> 00:21:59.814
We could.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4497-0
00:21:59.824 --> 00:22:02.699
It sounds like Shetty like even
some kind of whisker charts

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4497-1
00:22:02.699 --> 00:22:05.622
where we show kind of median
where are the outliers for each

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4497-2
00:22:05.622 --> 00:22:07.874
of these and slice that
different ways, right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4509-0
00:22:09.464 --> 00:22:13.134
So yeah, so these were the
three.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4564-0
00:22:13.144 --> 00:22:17.583
So the heat map size refer to
comparison on price competitive,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4564-1
00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:22.233
but at the procedure slash visit
type level uh to compare how one

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4564-2
00:22:22.233 --> 00:22:26.531
planned rates compared to others
in that market which is why

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4564-3
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:30.547
having narrowed down to a common
geography was important

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4564-4
00:22:30.547 --> 00:22:31.534
reimbursement.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4567-0
00:22:31.544 --> 00:22:33.544
Benchmarking ohh.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4569-0
00:22:34.604 --> 00:22:36.824
Reimbursement between.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4576-0
00:22:38.264 --> 00:22:40.004
Umm, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4621-0
00:22:40.014 --> 00:22:44.780
So once a heat map, the other is
perhaps looking at, you know by

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4621-1
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.887
procedure and the network
adequacy to look to see where

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4621-2
00:22:48.887 --> 00:22:53.287
you've got potentially and we
see if the data would support

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4621-3
00:22:53.287 --> 00:22:56.514
this sort of analysis for
network adequacy.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4646-0
00:22:57.024 --> 00:23:00.974
You know, do you have areas
where you know, certain plans,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4646-1
00:23:00.974 --> 00:23:04.723
fewer plans have contracted
rates for certain specialty

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4646-2
00:23:04.723 --> 00:23:06.464
types, umm, or procedures?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4668-0
00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:15.892
So that's where we're merging in
maybe our data to say where are

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4668-1
00:23:15.892 --> 00:23:17.274
we seeing these gaps, right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4677-0
00:23:17.284 --> 00:23:20.054
And and by county or whatever,
where there's no coverage.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4689-0
00:23:20.064 --> 00:23:20.764
Who's at the idea?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4699-0
00:23:21.494 --> 00:23:24.780
That would that part of the goal
is of combine combining in our

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4699-1
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.294
demo data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4719-0
00:23:30.104 --> 00:23:37.554
Uh, but the the the demo data
would be looking at ohm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4735-0
00:23:37.994 --> 00:23:39.384
You know our heat map.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4784-0
00:23:40.214 --> 00:23:44.578
So if you were to take in our
demo data and compare umm rates

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4784-1
00:23:44.578 --> 00:23:48.519
and let's just say it's our
customer, our customer data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4784-2
00:23:48.519 --> 00:23:53.164
compared to the data source from
the tech files, how do you start

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4784-3
00:23:53.164 --> 00:23:57.669
to create insight for the health
plan around where they've got,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4784-4
00:23:57.669 --> 00:24:00.414
you know rate discrepancies in
market?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4792-0
00:24:17.784 --> 00:24:20.034
So. Umm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4795-0
00:24:26.674 --> 00:24:27.064
What?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4818-0
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:29.637
So what's it getting back to the
original, you know kind of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4818-1
00:24:29.637 --> 00:24:31.304
question and that we started off
with.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4842-0
00:24:31.314 --> 00:24:35.437
So, you know, at the end of the
day, our goal right now is how

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4842-1
00:24:35.437 --> 00:24:37.794
do we get to a normalized data
set.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4904-0
00:24:37.884 --> 00:24:41.384
So the the downstream analytics,
if we can narrow the scope as to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4904-1
00:24:41.384 --> 00:24:44.619
which of the files from UHC,
Cigna, HCSC kind of question we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4904-2
00:24:44.619 --> 00:24:48.013
need to answer is which regions
from those data sets do we want

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4904-3
00:24:48.013 --> 00:24:51.089
to make part of this initial
scope so that we can keep it

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4904-4
00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:53.264
finite and you know make
progress on it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4933-0
00:24:54.524 --> 00:24:57.458
You know, I wanna make it more
than one market, but you know,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4933-1
00:24:57.458 --> 00:25:00.061
UHC is massive, so I don't
necessarily wanna do all of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4933-2
00:25:00.061 --> 00:25:00.724
their markets.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4946-0
00:25:02.344 --> 00:25:06.134
Umm, you know, knowing that HCSC
off the bat is what?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4952-0
00:25:06.144 --> 00:25:08.184
Nevada, Texas, Illinois.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4954-0
00:25:10.324 --> 00:25:10.534
It's.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4963-0
00:25:10.544 --> 00:25:11.934
Yeah, it's actually not. Not
Nevada.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4971-0
00:25:11.944 --> 00:25:13.004
It's gonna be New Mexico.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4975-0
00:25:13.354 --> 00:25:14.294
New Mexico, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4999-0
00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:18.308
Oklahoma, Montana and then
Texas, Illinois and the and by

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4995-0
00:25:16.284 --> 00:25:18.624
Want to Texas?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/4999-1
00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:20.794
far the biggest or Texas,
Illinois.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5022-0
00:25:20.804 --> 00:25:22.814
Those are the biggies. Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5007-0
00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:21.994
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5040-0
00:25:22.794 --> 00:25:25.194
And you know, is going to have a
presence in both of those as

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5040-1
00:25:25.194 --> 00:25:26.394
well and I believe so is Cigna.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5033-0
00:25:26.964 --> 00:25:27.254
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5057-0
00:25:27.304 --> 00:25:30.561
So we could just pick, you know,
Texas, Illinois maybe when other

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5057-1
00:25:30.561 --> 00:25:32.634
state you know third largest or
whatever.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5055-0
00:25:34.144 --> 00:25:34.554
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5099-0
00:25:34.604 --> 00:25:38.416
And and David just wanted to
call out that we were not able

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5099-1
00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:42.419
to access signal files from from
offshore from India primarily

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5099-2
00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:46.486
because I think it's restricted
to only US you as only access I

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5099-3
00:25:46.486 --> 00:25:46.994
believe.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5149-0
00:25:47.204 --> 00:25:50.562
So you know that is that is
something that we are trying to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5149-1
00:25:50.562 --> 00:25:53.865
sort out by bringing in an
onshore resource that will work

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5149-2
00:25:53.865 --> 00:25:57.223
closely so that they they can
access and mask whatever data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5149-3
00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:59.574
that they need to mask and send
it to us.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5178-0
00:25:59.584 --> 00:26:02.689
So just wanted to call that out
as well, David, when we started

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5178-1
00:26:02.689 --> 00:26:05.747
analyzing the files, signal was
something that was we were not

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5178-2
00:26:05.747 --> 00:26:07.154
able to access from offshore.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5180-0
00:26:09.324 --> 00:26:09.564
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5182-0
00:26:14.244 --> 00:26:14.664
Interesting.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5190-0
00:26:18.684 --> 00:26:20.244
OK, alright, that's good to
know.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5196-0
00:26:30.454 --> 00:26:30.804
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5254-0
00:26:30.814 --> 00:26:34.072
So David, when you know when
Michael was talking about

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5254-1
00:26:34.072 --> 00:26:37.863
accessing New Mexico and a few
other states, so can we say that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5254-2
00:26:37.863 --> 00:26:41.536
for UHC files, can we look out
for those specific regions and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5254-3
00:26:41.536 --> 00:26:44.794
extract the data and use them
for the standardization?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5249-0
00:26:43.284 --> 00:26:43.644
Texas.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5262-0
00:26:45.294 --> 00:26:46.504
Yeah, Texas and Illinois.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5263-0
00:26:47.244 --> 00:26:48.034
Takes as an element.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5265-0
00:26:48.044 --> 00:26:48.224
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5267-0
00:26:49.324 --> 00:26:49.754
Yeah, sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5270-0
00:26:52.364 --> 00:26:52.624
Bye.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5274-0
00:26:53.054 --> 00:26:53.294
What?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5313-0
00:26:53.574 --> 00:26:56.324
So those regions we can
concentrate and if we are able

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5313-1
00:26:56.324 --> 00:26:59.224
to extract the data from
H&amp;UC files for those regions

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5313-2
00:26:59.224 --> 00:27:02.124
and we are able to standardize
them, that could be a good

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5313-3
00:27:02.124 --> 00:27:02.424
start.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5337-0
00:27:02.434 --> 00:27:04.830
And obviously when when we are
able to bring in Sigma, we can

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5337-1
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.034
also look out for those regions
from Sigma file as well.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5340-0
00:27:08.504 --> 00:27:09.054
Yes.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5355-0
00:27:09.164 --> 00:27:13.724
Yep, I'd say, uh, you know
Anthony and edgier.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5346-0
00:27:10.274 --> 00:27:10.434
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5362-0
00:27:13.734 --> 00:27:15.304
Your help keep me honest here.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5374-0
00:27:15.814 --> 00:27:19.346
You know from an approach
perspective, I mentioned in

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5374-1
00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:20.654
figuring out how we.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5429-0
00:27:21.724 --> 00:27:25.460
Land the data in our lake and
then transform into a standard

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5429-1
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:29.196
format cause part of this body
of work is is getting to that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5429-2
00:27:29.196 --> 00:27:32.626
you know, data like being a
source for however the data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5429-3
00:27:32.626 --> 00:27:36.363
wants to come to us and then we
do the transformation on the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5429-4
00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:36.914
back end.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5434-0
00:27:36.924 --> 00:27:38.094
So I don't have that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5523-0
00:27:38.144 --> 00:27:41.851
It's not a tech person, so maybe
a dumb statement here, but I do

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5523-1
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:45.386
know that part of what we're
trying to prove out with this is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5523-2
00:27:45.386 --> 00:27:48.979
that notion of the accept the
data in any format and then work

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5523-3
00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:52.572
to get it into our data model
and standardized a format on the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5523-4
00:27:52.572 --> 00:27:55.708
back end and that has
applicability to other use cases

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5523-5
00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:58.674
we're solving for, for our
customers down the road.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5525-0
00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:00.844
Do we have a target database?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5555-0
00:28:00.854 --> 00:28:03.858
And again I'm I apologize, being
kind of new new to this, but you

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5555-1
00:28:03.858 --> 00:28:06.771
know obviously we have you know,
Vertica, Mondrian, but this is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5555-2
00:28:06.771 --> 00:28:07.454
an opportunity.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5558-0
00:28:07.464 --> 00:28:08.374
It's so new.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5580-0
00:28:08.444 --> 00:28:11.434
Could we look at a redshift or
snowflake or some other?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5626-0
00:28:11.564 --> 00:28:15.499
You know the database as the
place to unify this, and that's

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5608-0
00:28:12.304 --> 00:28:15.784
And if I believe we're looking
at the yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5626-1
00:28:15.499 --> 00:28:18.724
our 4A into a new a new cloud
database, you know.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5611-0
00:28:16.204 --> 00:28:16.314
Yes.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5630-0
00:28:19.194 --> 00:28:19.714
That's yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5620-0
00:28:19.434 --> 00:28:19.704
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5635-0
00:28:19.714 --> 00:28:22.584
So we're we're looking to do a
data like model.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5654-0
00:28:22.654 --> 00:28:26.360
So it's not a database like a
redshift or snowflake, it's it's

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5652-0
00:28:25.264 --> 00:28:25.534
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5654-1
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.184
the data lake.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5667-0
00:28:27.194 --> 00:28:31.124
So it'll reside in S3 and use
these services from S3.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5682-0
00:28:31.134 --> 00:28:33.014
So yeah, here's the architecture
coming up here.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5679-0
00:28:32.354 --> 00:28:32.544
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5694-0
00:28:32.554 --> 00:28:36.674
OK, so so so we'll, we'll we'll
land them in their disparate

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5694-1
00:28:36.674 --> 00:28:37.214
formats.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5748-0
00:28:37.224 --> 00:28:41.873
And you're saying, well, have
some kind of pipeline to unify

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5748-1
00:28:41.873 --> 00:28:46.598
those into a common format and
that'll be in a in a data lake

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5748-2
00:28:46.598 --> 00:28:48.504
format you're saying, OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5729-0
00:28:46.784 --> 00:28:47.274
Yes.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5744-0
00:28:47.174 --> 00:28:48.324
Correct, correct.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5735-0
00:28:47.284 --> 00:28:47.694
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5737-0
00:28:47.704 --> 00:28:48.124
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5767-0
00:28:48.184 --> 00:28:51.378
So Anthony, Anthony, let me add
in a little bit cause I think

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5767-1
00:28:51.378 --> 00:28:54.624
you and I've been chatting by
teams and my my team is morning.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5808-0
00:28:54.634 --> 00:28:58.920
I just talked to Siri, so I
think the plan here, and I know

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5808-1
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.564
that with iceberg is to create a
structured data set so it's the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5808-2
00:29:03.564 --> 00:29:08.137
same indeed of science needs the
same thing that we're building

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5808-3
00:29:08.137 --> 00:29:08.494
here.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5831-0
00:29:09.404 --> 00:29:13.378
So the end result in the lake,
the final version of the lake

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5831-1
00:29:13.378 --> 00:29:15.594
will be that accessible data
set.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5851-0
00:29:15.604 --> 00:29:19.657
So if they're structured
similarly, and I know that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5851-1
00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:23.164
Anthony's got great, great work
around that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5888-0
00:29:23.174 --> 00:29:27.762
So transforming it from that raw
data to the work that we can use

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5888-1
00:29:27.762 --> 00:29:31.795
for power BI or Python or
whatever, we're going to use is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5888-2
00:29:31.795 --> 00:29:36.175
in that that center lake with
iceberg providing the structured

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5888-3
00:29:36.175 --> 00:29:37.774
output correct Anthony.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5911-0
00:29:40.054 --> 00:29:42.934
Uh, yeah, so this is the same
model that we're looking to use

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5909-0
00:29:41.454 --> 00:29:41.754
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5911-1
00:29:42.934 --> 00:29:43.584
for, uh, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5936-0
00:29:43.594 --> 00:29:45.104
The data science team we're
looking to use the.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5921-0
00:29:44.254 --> 00:29:45.004
Yeah, exactly.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5926-0
00:29:45.014 --> 00:29:45.484
It's the same.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5930-0
00:29:45.494 --> 00:29:45.704
Yes.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5932-0
00:29:45.714 --> 00:29:46.084
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5994-0
00:29:46.274 --> 00:29:50.587
So Mike, to your question, we're
trying to Anthony and team are

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5994-1
00:29:50.587 --> 00:29:54.766
courting standard process using
what's on here and we've been

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5994-2
00:29:54.766 --> 00:29:58.945
doing this in the the Data Lake
team has been working on this

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5972-0
00:29:55.334 --> 00:29:55.534
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5994-3
00:29:58.945 --> 00:30:01.304
for about a month and 1/2 now,
so.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/5984-0
00:29:59.004 --> 00:30:01.394
OK, OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6011-0
00:30:01.404 --> 00:30:04.614
So if I understand this, so we
have our our huge raw files in

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6011-1
00:30:04.614 --> 00:30:06.064
sitting in these S3 buckets.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6014-0
00:30:06.074 --> 00:30:07.044
That's where we landed.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6049-0
00:30:07.234 --> 00:30:12.493
We're gonna have a much for the
POC, a smaller maybe it's just a

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6049-1
00:30:12.493 --> 00:30:17.024
slice of that in the iceberg
format, I guess, right or.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6061-0
00:30:17.164 --> 00:30:20.134
And and be the the ride.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6065-0
00:30:20.144 --> 00:30:21.784
It all get landed right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6070-0
00:30:23.834 --> 00:30:24.124
Uh.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6081-0
00:30:24.134 --> 00:30:24.314
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6098-0
00:30:24.324 --> 00:30:25.554
And S3, that's correct.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6088-0
00:30:24.384 --> 00:30:25.834
And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6118-0
00:30:25.844 --> 00:30:28.344
There's three, and then the lake
will be in S3 too, so it's all.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6163-0
00:30:28.234 --> 00:30:31.357
That they'll have a
transformation and we're going

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6163-1
00:30:31.357 --> 00:30:35.154
to just the transformation will
only focus on our POC limited

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6163-2
00:30:35.154 --> 00:30:39.135
part of the data set is that is
that accurate or are we going to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6163-3
00:30:39.135 --> 00:30:40.544
do more than that this.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6154-0
00:30:40.014 --> 00:30:41.154
I believe that's what that
that's.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6208-0
00:30:41.164 --> 00:30:44.871
Yeah, that's what we're looking
to do is is bring the data in

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6176-0
00:30:44.044 --> 00:30:44.224
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6208-1
00:30:44.871 --> 00:30:48.578
and use this this structure,
this data like format to make it

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6208-2
00:30:48.578 --> 00:30:52.165
usable and those other pieces
treeno and other other pieces

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6208-3
00:30:52.165 --> 00:30:55.274
right now that we're not
currently leveraging. Yep.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6213-0
00:30:56.164 --> 00:30:56.344
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6261-0
00:30:56.494 --> 00:30:59.597
Yeah, but just one one
additional point to what Anthony

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6261-1
00:30:59.597 --> 00:31:02.258
just mentioned, there can be
some part of small

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6261-2
00:31:02.258 --> 00:31:05.527
transformation that will be
applied in terms of flattening

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6237-0
00:31:03.714 --> 00:31:03.914
Right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6261-3
00:31:05.527 --> 00:31:08.964
the the Jacksons because all
these data are going to be from,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6261-4
00:31:08.964 --> 00:31:11.624
in, in the JSON format from from
these systems.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6287-0
00:31:11.634 --> 00:31:15.799
So we might do and only one
level of transformation in terms

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6287-1
00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:18.804
of flattening that into into the
raw layer.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6304-0
00:31:18.814 --> 00:31:21.864
So just just want to add the
point, Anthony hope that that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6304-1
00:31:21.864 --> 00:31:22.484
that's fine.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6307-0
00:31:23.634 --> 00:31:24.674
Yeah, sounds good.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6306-0
00:31:24.564 --> 00:31:24.784
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6310-0
00:31:27.234 --> 00:31:27.614
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6320-0
00:31:27.694 --> 00:31:29.684
And and for transformations we
are.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6341-0
00:31:29.734 --> 00:31:34.764
We are going to use the glue,
the glue, glue and spark right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6333-0
00:31:32.054 --> 00:31:32.614
Spock.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6337-0
00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:33.004
Yep.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6344-0
00:31:33.354 --> 00:31:33.984
Close park. Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6368-0
00:31:34.774 --> 00:31:39.567
So and and iceberg will serve as
you know, a transformed you know

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6368-1
00:31:39.567 --> 00:31:43.344
layer where all the data will be
stored in iceberg.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6378-0
00:31:43.574 --> 00:31:47.664
Because iceberg has certain
Delta Lake type of capabilities.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6388-0
00:31:47.714 --> 00:31:49.564
So that's something that we want
to use.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6425-0
00:31:49.634 --> 00:31:53.511
Trino is more of a intermediary
between iceberg and the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6425-1
00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:57.943
visualization, so we can think
of, you know, as a very low code

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6425-2
00:31:57.943 --> 00:32:00.574
UI which is similar to Athena in
AWS.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6445-0
00:32:00.584 --> 00:32:03.695
So allowing end users to start
querying from the database they

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6445-1
00:32:03.695 --> 00:32:06.214
want to check out some records
and whatnot, right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6450-0
00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:06.954
Not necessarily.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6467-0
00:32:06.964 --> 00:32:09.943
Depending on the visualization
layer, always so that was the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6467-1
00:32:09.943 --> 00:32:11.994
thought process behind bringing
in treno.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6476-0
00:32:12.364 --> 00:32:14.104
So yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6493-0
00:32:14.204 --> 00:32:17.015
So for Torino is is there a
Tableau connector to that as

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6493-1
00:32:17.015 --> 00:32:18.544
well that we could use Tableau?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6491-0
00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:19.934
Ohm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6501-0
00:32:19.914 --> 00:32:20.194
I.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6495-0
00:32:20.164 --> 00:32:20.814
Yeah, we.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6518-0
00:32:20.904 --> 00:32:24.211
Yeah, I think we have a an, I
think we we used Power BI for

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6518-1
00:32:24.211 --> 00:32:25.314
in, in, in the past.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6529-0
00:32:25.324 --> 00:32:27.354
So, but yeah, we can quickly
confirm that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6541-0
00:32:27.364 --> 00:32:29.694
But remember it has connectors
for all.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6539-0
00:32:27.764 --> 00:32:27.924
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6545-0
00:32:29.974 --> 00:32:30.524
All of them, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6544-0
00:32:30.014 --> 00:32:30.214
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6583-0
00:32:37.844 --> 00:32:40.704
Yes, it does have a connector
problem.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6582-0
00:32:37.964 --> 00:32:40.524
And that's OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6571-0
00:32:39.454 --> 00:32:40.634
Yeah, the tree node does have.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6587-0
00:32:40.644 --> 00:32:43.524
I just checked it two does have
a tablet connected Michael.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6596-0
00:32:44.374 --> 00:32:44.554
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6592-0
00:32:44.604 --> 00:32:44.744
No.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6618-0
00:32:45.764 --> 00:32:50.538
And and this and this, Trina is
going to be like the the the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6618-1
00:32:50.538 --> 00:32:54.374
physical form of a of a table on
top of iceberg.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6662-0
00:32:54.384 --> 00:32:59.362
So the iceberg is is the way of
storing the data on the on the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6662-1
00:32:59.362 --> 00:33:04.420
on the data leak on S3 and it's
got its own advantages of as it

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6662-2
00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.134
compliant and we can do more
schema evolution.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6672-0
00:33:08.144 --> 00:33:09.734
All those properties will come
in as.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6720-0
00:33:09.744 --> 00:33:13.468
When when we when we store it as
an iceberg format still that's

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6720-1
00:33:13.468 --> 00:33:17.308
going to sit on on top of S3 and
we are going to have trino which

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6720-2
00:33:17.308 --> 00:33:21.091
is going to use the glue catalog
for, for, for these files where

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6720-3
00:33:21.091 --> 00:33:23.244
we can see it like a physical
table.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6752-0
00:33:23.254 --> 00:33:26.932
So Trino will give that layer of
writing sequels if you want to,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6752-1
00:33:26.932 --> 00:33:30.385
and we can have power BI or
Tableau on top of sitting on top

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6752-2
00:33:30.385 --> 00:33:31.064
of you know.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6761-0
00:33:39.634 --> 00:33:40.464
I think you're on mute.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6773-0
00:33:52.924 --> 00:33:55.254
And and I just mentioned about,
sorry.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6776-0
00:33:59.044 --> 00:33:59.514
Anthony.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6792-0
00:33:59.564 --> 00:34:00.044
Ohh sorry.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6817-0
00:34:00.404 --> 00:34:02.446
It what Mike was gonna say
something, but I don't know if

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6817-1
00:34:02.446 --> 00:34:02.974
Michael saying.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6804-0
00:34:02.534 --> 00:34:03.354
Oh yeah, I I was.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6821-0
00:34:03.364 --> 00:34:05.484
I was asking you, but I didn't
have any any questions.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6832-0
00:34:05.574 --> 00:34:05.814
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6830-0
00:34:06.154 --> 00:34:07.544
I think that that all make
sense.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6833-0
00:34:07.554 --> 00:34:07.824
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6837-0
00:34:07.884 --> 00:34:08.174
Thank you.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6839-0
00:34:09.074 --> 00:34:09.464
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6875-0
00:34:09.974 --> 00:34:13.635
So Anthony, you mentioned about
or or I think I'm not sure it

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6875-1
00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:17.238
was my Mike or you, Anthony, I
think you spoke about the the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6875-2
00:34:17.238 --> 00:34:20.604
data science team also has a
similar data leak approach.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6916-0
00:34:20.694 --> 00:34:25.356
So just want to understand like
is there a a need of the static

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6916-1
00:34:25.356 --> 00:34:29.800
data into the data science world
as well or it's going to be

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6916-2
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.224
something in the future in the
plan something.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6926-0
00:34:34.514 --> 00:34:38.064
I'm I'm not sure of the long
term plans. There are.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6935-0
00:34:38.074 --> 00:34:39.654
Are you talking about statistics
though?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6941-0
00:34:39.694 --> 00:34:40.464
Off the data or what?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6978-0
00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:45.143
Yeah, you didn't mention about
the the, the that that is some

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6978-1
00:34:45.143 --> 00:34:48.216
some one other team that is
working on the data science on

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6978-2
00:34:48.216 --> 00:34:51.341
the similar architecture with in
iceberg and and and and S3

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/6978-3
00:34:51.341 --> 00:34:51.654
right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7026-0
00:34:51.664 --> 00:34:55.761
So just wanted to know whether
the thick data is also been will

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7026-1
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:59.603
may be used in the future, so or
it's it's going to be very

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7017-0
00:34:57.734 --> 00:34:59.424
Oh, I see. Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7026-2
00:34:59.603 --> 00:35:01.524
unique in the use case. Sorry.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7035-0
00:35:02.174 --> 00:35:05.004
I think I I think it might be
used potentially leverage.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7056-0
00:35:05.014 --> 00:35:07.560
I don't know how it'll be
integrated at this point, but we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7056-1
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.934
have a similar architecture for
the data science team.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7067-0
00:35:09.944 --> 00:35:12.164
That's how we're providing them
access to the data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7134-0
00:35:12.174 --> 00:35:15.810
So it's similar architecture,
but I don't know if it'll be

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7077-0
00:35:13.104 --> 00:35:13.344
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7134-1
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.447
using the same way because the
data science team also does

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7134-2
00:35:19.447 --> 00:35:23.330
research into research and other
things, so this might be more

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7134-3
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.843
for general for the business use
cases and more for like

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7134-4
00:35:26.843 --> 00:35:29.124
consumers using power BI or
Tableau.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7129-0
00:35:30.254 --> 00:35:30.644
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7132-0
00:35:30.684 --> 00:35:31.004
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7135-0
00:35:31.054 --> 00:35:31.334
Thanks.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7139-0
00:35:31.344 --> 00:35:32.004
Thanks, Anthony.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7154-0
00:35:32.154 --> 00:35:35.144
And that that was one other
point on the the demo data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7165-0
00:35:35.154 --> 00:35:38.404
I think, David, you mentioned
about the demo data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7243-0
00:35:38.414 --> 00:35:42.433
So just to for for, for our
clarity, it's it's the MIDI data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7243-1
00:35:42.433 --> 00:35:46.651
that that you are talking as a
demo data, OK and we want to see

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7201-0
00:35:43.044 --> 00:35:44.784
Correct. Yep.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7243-2
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:50.934
that that has given as an input
and then see how the other plans

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7243-3
00:35:50.934 --> 00:35:54.953
are compare or or or equivalent
of of those are in the other

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7243-4
00:35:54.953 --> 00:35:58.709
other UHC and HCSC and that's
the comparison that we are

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7243-5
00:35:58.709 --> 00:35:59.434
looking at.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7271-0
00:35:59.444 --> 00:36:02.301
So the demo data has become the
input and then the data from

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7271-1
00:36:02.301 --> 00:36:04.784
these two systems will become
the comparison points.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7274-0
00:36:06.074 --> 00:36:07.314
It's I.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7303-0
00:36:07.354 --> 00:36:10.729
Maybe I mean the the the data
sets themselves if we get let's

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7289-0
00:36:08.714 --> 00:36:08.934
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7303-1
00:36:10.729 --> 00:36:12.254
say we get Cigna in the mix.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7316-0
00:36:12.264 --> 00:36:16.064
I mean, at one point I
comparison is Cigna UHC to HCSC.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7369-0
00:36:16.634 --> 00:36:20.270
Ultimately, we talked the reason
why the demo data is in the mix

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7369-1
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.795
is if we get done with this POC,
but we've not yet solved for,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7369-2
00:36:23.795 --> 00:36:27.319
how do I comingle my production
data with this data, then I've

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7369-3
00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:30.564
got an interesting science
experiment, but not much more.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7410-0
00:36:30.794 --> 00:36:33.998
However, if I can get the demo
data connected to it, then as we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7381-0
00:36:30.894 --> 00:36:31.044
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7410-1
00:36:33.998 --> 00:36:37.101
go out and we talk about this
concept with customers and they

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7410-2
00:36:37.101 --> 00:36:39.454
go, I would love to have that
module added in.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7445-0
00:36:39.464 --> 00:36:42.509
We've actually already solved
for how I get production data,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7445-1
00:36:42.509 --> 00:36:45.654
but I can't just use a customers
data, which is why I say demo

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7445-2
00:36:45.654 --> 00:36:45.904
data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7516-0
00:36:47.214 --> 00:36:50.682
So so for the demo data we would
we just take like all of those

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7454-0
00:36:47.374 --> 00:36:48.014
Just clear. Thanks.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7455-0
00:36:47.754 --> 00:36:47.984
Got.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7516-1
00:36:50.682 --> 00:36:54.205
dimensions, geography provider,
those procedure codes, whatever,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7516-2
00:36:54.205 --> 00:36:57.457
it just extracts of those that
we can similarly flatten and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7516-3
00:36:57.457 --> 00:37:00.438
then that'll be sort of
alongside this data maybe in a

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7516-4
00:37:00.438 --> 00:37:03.744
different table or something and
then that that opens up the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7516-5
00:37:03.744 --> 00:37:06.454
analysis then to join those and
look at it right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7519-0
00:37:06.574 --> 00:37:07.404
So I'm just.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7541-0
00:37:07.454 --> 00:37:10.567
I'm just thinking like we can
come up with, even if it's just

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7541-1
00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:12.324
spreadsheet exports to begin
with.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7552-0
00:37:12.584 --> 00:37:14.214
Hey, here's the data we wanna
pull out.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7554-0
00:37:14.864 --> 00:37:15.454
Umm.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7603-0
00:37:15.914 --> 00:37:18.975
And then we can have a more
elaborate way to to to do that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7603-1
00:37:18.975 --> 00:37:22.191
in a production environment to,
you know, on a monthly basis,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7603-2
00:37:22.191 --> 00:37:25.252
whatever there's a, there's
gonna be some pull of the data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7603-3
00:37:25.252 --> 00:37:28.053
from the production system, but
it doesn't have to be

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7603-4
00:37:28.053 --> 00:37:28.624
everything.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7620-0
00:37:28.634 --> 00:37:31.024
It's just the specific
dimensions and metrics we're

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7620-1
00:37:31.024 --> 00:37:31.944
interested in there.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7632-0
00:37:32.974 --> 00:37:35.104
So I see that as part of this
too is what?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7647-0
00:37:35.114 --> 00:37:38.016
What is the specific dimensions
and measures that we're gonna

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7647-1
00:37:38.016 --> 00:37:38.484
pull from?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7655-0
00:37:38.814 --> 00:37:40.894
Does certainly doesn't have to
be everything right?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7674-0
00:37:40.904 --> 00:37:44.839
Just just kind of marry it up
with what we have from the the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7674-1
00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:45.484
TIF files.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7675-0
00:37:46.344 --> 00:37:46.524
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7681-0
00:37:46.354 --> 00:37:46.514
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7677-0
00:37:47.514 --> 00:37:47.884
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7690-0
00:37:47.894 --> 00:37:51.024
And and and David, where would
that demo data be currently?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-0
00:37:51.034 --> 00:37:55.114
Is it in in Madea's Vertica
database or is it somewhere yeah

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7707-0
00:37:53.914 --> 00:37:54.094
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-1
00:37:55.114 --> 00:37:59.328
OK so so that would probably be
added to the the scope as well

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-2
00:37:59.328 --> 00:38:03.073
primarily because you know while
the the first scope is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-3
00:38:03.073 --> 00:38:06.685
definitely to build the data
platform, as Anthony was

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-4
00:38:06.685 --> 00:38:10.699
telling, the second is to be
able to commingle the Uchc and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-5
00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:14.578
SIGNA files specifically for
let's say, the three regions

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-6
00:38:14.578 --> 00:38:18.524
that you mentioned, New Mexico,
Illinois and the the third

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-7
00:38:18.524 --> 00:38:22.604
region and and then be able to
pick up the demo data for the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-8
00:38:22.604 --> 00:38:26.618
same regions and then do a
comparison between the demo data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7817-9
00:38:26.618 --> 00:38:29.494
versus USC versus HHC versus
Sigma, right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7821-0
00:38:29.504 --> 00:38:30.834
So it did.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7824-0
00:38:30.844 --> 00:38:31.174
I did.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7837-0
00:38:31.184 --> 00:38:35.294
I kind of give an give my
understanding of the scope.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7847-0
00:38:35.504 --> 00:38:38.734
Is there any mistake or is there
anything that I missed?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7858-0
00:38:43.364 --> 00:38:45.494
No, I think you're right, I
think. Uh.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7899-0
00:38:48.554 --> 00:38:52.229
So we need to revisit the the
scope question because I know in

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7899-1
00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:55.963
the the SOW we've got a bullet
point in there counting for this

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7899-2
00:38:55.963 --> 00:38:58.997
of provide comparison
capabilities with our current

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7899-3
00:38:58.997 --> 00:39:00.164
media enriched data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7914-0
00:39:00.454 --> 00:39:04.891
So so that so it was
contemplated in the original

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7914-1
00:39:04.891 --> 00:39:05.424
scope.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7927-0
00:39:05.434 --> 00:39:07.144
We need maybe talk through the
how on that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7925-0
00:39:05.894 --> 00:39:06.134
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7932-0
00:39:08.094 --> 00:39:09.744
Yeah, absolutely, David.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7943-0
00:39:09.754 --> 00:39:12.284
I I don't think the technicality
is a problem there.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7984-0
00:39:12.294 --> 00:39:15.546
We just need to get Vertica
connected to the to to this

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7955-0
00:39:12.824 --> 00:39:12.984
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7984-1
00:39:15.546 --> 00:39:19.146
whole data platform to be able
to extract it, we just need to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7980-0
00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:18.354
Sure. Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/7984-2
00:39:19.146 --> 00:39:21.004
add that pipeline as part of it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8047-0
00:39:21.074 --> 00:39:24.688
So so, Anthony, one request you
know post this call, I will send

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8047-1
00:39:24.688 --> 00:39:28.023
a mom, we might want to to make
sure that the next phase of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8047-2
00:39:28.023 --> 00:39:31.304
design we might want to get all
the access to the vertical

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8047-3
00:39:31.304 --> 00:39:34.862
databases a little ahead of the
curve so that we can also start

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8047-4
00:39:34.862 --> 00:39:37.364
analyzing the data schema of
this demo data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8066-0
00:39:37.494 --> 00:39:41.587
So that we can start building
the design for, you know, the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8066-1
00:39:41.587 --> 00:39:43.224
for this first use case.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8070-0
00:39:43.234 --> 00:39:43.804
Antony, I'll.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8083-0
00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:46.135
I'll probably send the note and
we can have a discussion around

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8083-1
00:39:46.135 --> 00:39:46.244
it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8087-0
00:39:46.394 --> 00:39:47.084
Thank you, Sir. Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8100-0
00:39:53.184 --> 00:39:53.714
Yeah, and.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8107-0
00:39:54.384 --> 00:39:57.234
So I do I do suspect on this on
the tick one especially.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8129-0
00:39:57.244 --> 00:40:00.059
There's probably going to be a
lot more code discovery, and I

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8129-1
00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:02.784
can appreciate it's like well,
hey, we've got these things.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8167-0
00:40:02.794 --> 00:40:06.132
So I think having this this
mutual working understanding of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8167-1
00:40:06.132 --> 00:40:09.637
you guys are gonna come across,
you know, questions and things

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8167-2
00:40:09.637 --> 00:40:12.976
we need to reconcile and solve
for and with folks we've got

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8167-3
00:40:12.976 --> 00:40:13.254
here.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8179-0
00:40:13.264 --> 00:40:16.474
If we need other experts, we'll
get them engaged.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8210-0
00:40:16.484 --> 00:40:19.421
But I think for this one we'll
we'll need a little bit reliant

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8190-0
00:40:17.434 --> 00:40:17.604
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8210-1
00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:22.451
upon you guys to surface up some
of the key decisions we need to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8210-2
00:40:22.451 --> 00:40:22.684
make.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8258-0
00:40:23.184 --> 00:40:27.491
Umm, I think for the the patient
satisfaction we've got Dave Wolf

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8258-1
00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:31.799
on the phone, we're a little bit
clearer, alright and it can be a

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8258-2
00:40:31.799 --> 00:40:35.715
little bit more prescriptive in
that one and that one quite

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8258-3
00:40:35.715 --> 00:40:39.174
frankly should be a little bit
more straightforward.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8281-0
00:40:39.184 --> 00:40:42.704
It's not gonna be as much around
normalization of disparate data

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8281-1
00:40:42.704 --> 00:40:44.924
sets, but rather how do we
quickly land?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8315-0
00:40:46.114 --> 00:40:50.092
A known data asset that may be
different than anything else we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8315-1
00:40:50.092 --> 00:40:53.880
have and get it quickly to a
place that can manifest itself

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8315-2
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.764
into our tool.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8312-0
00:40:55.924 --> 00:40:56.274
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8317-0
00:40:56.344 --> 00:40:56.694
Got it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8319-0
00:40:56.824 --> 00:40:57.504
Got it. Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8326-0
00:41:00.114 --> 00:41:00.294
Right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8350-0
00:41:01.264 --> 00:41:04.803
So one thing that's going to be
a challenge is I was looking at

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8350-1
00:41:04.803 --> 00:41:06.794
our demo data is for our demo
site.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8355-0
00:41:06.804 --> 00:41:09.674
We've completely anonymized the
provider information.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8361-0
00:41:10.164 --> 00:41:12.254
It's it's just basically
nonsense.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8385-0
00:41:12.684 --> 00:41:17.348
It's like provider 2241, so
we're not gonna be able to do

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8377-0
00:41:13.914 --> 00:41:14.214
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8385-1
00:41:17.348 --> 00:41:18.554
much with that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8399-0
00:41:19.684 --> 00:41:20.734
Now we do have good.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8417-0
00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:25.177
I think I believe that the demo
data just between me and you

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8417-1
00:41:25.177 --> 00:41:28.884
guys, it it came from some Texas
Illinois clients.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8446-0
00:41:28.894 --> 00:41:32.729
So I think the geography met
might be more accurate, but just

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8446-1
00:41:32.729 --> 00:41:36.502
I know I can see right away that
we don't have real provider

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8446-2
00:41:36.502 --> 00:41:38.914
information available, but it
doesn't.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8513-0
00:41:38.924 --> 00:41:43.008
It looks like it was sort of
totally anonymized or made fake,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8471-0
00:41:42.224 --> 00:41:44.574
OK, alright. OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8513-1
00:41:43.008 --> 00:41:46.895
so just something to consider
that we would might we might

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8470-0
00:41:44.334 --> 00:41:44.714
Got it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8513-2
00:41:46.895 --> 00:41:50.913
need to get permission from a
client as a as an early, early

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8542-0
00:41:50.524 --> 00:41:55.231
I don't, and I think with with
some yeah, with some basics,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8513-3
00:41:50.913 --> 00:41:52.494
participating, you know.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8542-1
00:41:55.231 --> 00:42:00.174
Mike, I think we probably could
pretty quickly get you know we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8542-2
00:42:00.174 --> 00:42:04.882
could probably get a AJ to bite
on permissions to use their

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8542-3
00:42:04.882 --> 00:42:05.274
data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8546-0
00:42:06.134 --> 00:42:07.724
You know, so here's what we
have.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8553-0
00:42:07.734 --> 00:42:08.424
This is our demo data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8562-0
00:42:08.434 --> 00:42:11.064
You can see this is our billing
provider dimension.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8570-0
00:42:11.334 --> 00:42:13.574
I've sliced this across Illinois
and Texas.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8592-0
00:42:13.584 --> 00:42:17.467
You can see we've got quite a
bit of data in Texas and it

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8592-1
00:42:17.467 --> 00:42:19.744
shows claim and paid
information.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8623-0
00:42:19.934 --> 00:42:23.900
You can see this is kind of a
nonsense ID here I think, yeah,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8617-0
00:42:23.084 --> 00:42:24.144
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8623-1
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.674
but this is the kind of data
that we could extract, right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8712-0
00:42:27.734 --> 00:42:31.490
Once a month or whatever and and
and throw in the the other

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8712-1
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:35.496
dimensions that are relevant and
that can get land that into S3

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8712-2
00:42:35.496 --> 00:42:39.502
or wherever we're going to land
it, you know, and we we do have

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8669-0
00:42:37.344 --> 00:42:37.604
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8712-3
00:42:39.502 --> 00:42:43.195
ways to even do this today
through some some connectors we

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8712-4
00:42:43.195 --> 00:42:47.076
we do web data, connectors and
things like that that we could

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8712-5
00:42:47.076 --> 00:42:51.082
leverage short term but this is
a way to get this data set just

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8712-6
00:42:51.082 --> 00:42:54.024
plugged into Tableau through a
data connector.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8735-0
00:42:55.054 --> 00:42:57.771
But I think the better way is to
get this into ask 3 land that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8735-1
00:42:57.771 --> 00:42:58.634
into S3 in some way.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8796-0
00:42:59.974 --> 00:43:03.386
Chuck, Chuck, and and Michael,
thanks for bringing that up

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8796-1
00:43:03.386 --> 00:43:07.088
because one of the things that
we also we have already done and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8796-2
00:43:07.088 --> 00:43:10.269
we could probably share it as
part of our ongoing code

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8796-3
00:43:10.269 --> 00:43:13.971
discovery process here is even
for the 18 key business elements

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8796-4
00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:17.384
that were listed as part of the
the user story or the SOW.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8801-0
00:43:18.114 --> 00:43:19.224
You know, I I was.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8813-0
00:43:19.234 --> 00:43:20.884
I'm just alluding to what Ashok
mentioned.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8855-0
00:43:20.894 --> 00:43:23.890
80% of the fields that we were
able to match there are about

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8855-1
00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:26.887
20% that we were not able to
match between the files and the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8855-2
00:43:26.887 --> 00:43:29.834
the requirements or the fields
that were listed in the SOW.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8867-0
00:43:30.284 --> 00:43:31.674
So we want to call that out as
well.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8904-0
00:43:31.904 --> 00:43:35.353
Maybe one of the things that we
can also find in the demo data,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8904-1
00:43:35.353 --> 00:43:38.747
we'll extend that analysis to
the demo data as well and to see

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8904-2
00:43:38.747 --> 00:43:42.034
how much of matches there right
away when when you mentioned

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8904-3
00:43:42.034 --> 00:43:42.304
that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8927-0
00:43:43.894 --> 00:43:46.719
The region wise mapping may not
always be there for all the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8927-1
00:43:46.719 --> 00:43:47.944
regions that we specified.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8930-0
00:43:47.994 --> 00:43:48.344
We will.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8952-0
00:43:48.354 --> 00:43:50.714
We will also figure that out and
add that as part of our

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8952-1
00:43:50.714 --> 00:43:51.584
analysis, uh Michael.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8957-0
00:43:51.574 --> 00:43:54.104
OK, because here's the other way
we could slice this.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8970-0
00:43:54.114 --> 00:43:57.524
This is the same view, but I
just put this primary CPT.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8990-0
00:43:57.534 --> 00:44:00.683
I don't know if this is the same
level of what we have in the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8990-1
00:44:00.683 --> 00:44:02.004
other files, but we could.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/8997-0
00:44:02.014 --> 00:44:02.944
We're happy to share.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9037-0
00:44:02.954 --> 00:44:06.883
We could you find the the kind
of matching up dimensions and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9037-1
00:44:06.883 --> 00:44:10.684
see and provide some Excel
exports or whatever it might be

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9037-2
00:44:10.684 --> 00:44:14.226
just to so you could sort of see
and there's codes and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9037-3
00:44:14.226 --> 00:44:15.064
descriptions.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9069-0
00:44:15.074 --> 00:44:18.786
Maybe it's just the code that we
have or I don't know how that

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9069-1
00:44:18.786 --> 00:44:22.203
data looks, but we can share
what's what's in in our demo

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9069-2
00:44:22.203 --> 00:44:23.794
data at this level as well.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9101-0
00:44:24.664 --> 00:44:28.516
So and I don't know what what
measures we're looking for, if

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9084-0
00:44:25.914 --> 00:44:26.314
Got it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9101-1
00:44:28.516 --> 00:44:32.495
it's claims you know, number of
claims paid amount, what other

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9101-2
00:44:32.495 --> 00:44:33.064
measures.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9112-0
00:44:33.074 --> 00:44:35.224
But we can we can marry up the
measures as well.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9124-0
00:44:35.294 --> 00:44:37.974
We have a bunch of different
measures that we can see.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9132-0
00:44:37.984 --> 00:44:40.454
We have dozens and dozens of
different measures available.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9136-0
00:44:44.914 --> 00:44:45.344
Got it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9138-0
00:44:45.394 --> 00:44:46.664
OK. Thanks.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9168-0
00:44:57.604 --> 00:44:58.214
So.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9171-0
00:44:58.284 --> 00:45:02.483
So David, I I know we are on the
top of the hour, but I I I feel

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9162-0
00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:00.774
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9171-1
00:45:02.483 --> 00:45:04.744
much better than where we
started.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9185-0
00:45:04.754 --> 00:45:07.274
So thanks for all the guidance
and inputs.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9184-0
00:45:05.564 --> 00:45:05.754
Yes.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9201-0
00:45:07.744 --> 00:45:10.534
So I I I would like to just
quickly summarize.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9230-0
00:45:10.864 --> 00:45:15.494
The takeaway is for for kanini
in terms of where we are when it

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9230-1
00:45:15.494 --> 00:45:19.690
comes to the tick files, I'll
also send a follow up email

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9230-2
00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:20.414
around it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9250-0
00:45:20.934 --> 00:45:25.241
So one of the the first thing is
to be able to pick up HCSC and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9250-1
00:45:25.241 --> 00:45:25.914
UHC files.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9262-0
00:45:25.924 --> 00:45:27.324
That's what we have access to
right now.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9299-0
00:45:27.784 --> 00:45:32.207
Specifically, focus on Nevada,
Illinois, three regions that you

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9299-1
00:45:32.207 --> 00:45:36.769
mentioned, David, and be able to
first make sure that we are able

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9299-2
00:45:36.769 --> 00:45:40.708
to combine these two datasets
and and and do the initial

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9299-3
00:45:40.708 --> 00:45:41.814
analysis, right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9312-0
00:45:41.824 --> 00:45:44.914
So that is going to be the scope
of this discovery.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9335-0
00:45:45.484 --> 00:45:48.538
We'll add that as part of the
scope of this particular

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9335-1
00:45:48.538 --> 00:45:49.094
discovery.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9359-0
00:45:49.104 --> 00:45:52.614
For this use case and also on
the on the dashboards and the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9359-1
00:45:52.614 --> 00:45:56.065
reporting like you rightly
called out in the SOW, whatever

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9359-2
00:45:56.065 --> 00:45:58.054
we have listed, we will add
that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9368-0
00:45:58.064 --> 00:45:59.154
So that is also part of the
scope.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9392-0
00:45:59.554 --> 00:46:02.550
The 18 columns that you
mentioned are going to be the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9392-1
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:05.491
ones that we are going to
extract from each of these

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9392-2
00:46:05.491 --> 00:46:05.824
files.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9439-0
00:46:06.554 --> 00:46:10.313
We will also add the demo data
that Michael was just showing as

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9439-1
00:46:10.313 --> 00:46:13.897
part of the scope to make sure
that now we'll have H UHC the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9439-2
00:46:13.897 --> 00:46:17.715
demo data and once we get access
to signal files, you know Sigma

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9439-3
00:46:17.715 --> 00:46:19.184
will also be added right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9465-0
00:46:19.194 --> 00:46:21.324
So I'll add that as part of the
scope, but Sigma files is

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9465-1
00:46:21.324 --> 00:46:22.904
something that we still don't
have access.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9500-0
00:46:22.914 --> 00:46:26.575
So we are trying to bring in a
resource in the US and associate

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9473-0
00:46:23.354 --> 00:46:23.504
Yeah.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9500-1
00:46:26.575 --> 00:46:30.179
in the US so that he can access
the signal files and then mask

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9500-2
00:46:30.179 --> 00:46:31.724
the data and give it to us.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9514-0
00:46:30.894 --> 00:46:31.074
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9504-0
00:46:31.734 --> 00:46:31.904
Right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9524-0
00:46:31.914 --> 00:46:33.054
So that could be something that
we could.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9538-0
00:46:31.914 --> 00:46:35.526
We'll also be if, if we know
we're narrowing the geography to

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9538-1
00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:38.964
human, our to Illinois and
Texas, we can also look to see.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9552-0
00:46:39.824 --> 00:46:42.974
Umm, you know, there's some
other options we could look at.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9567-0
00:46:42.984 --> 00:46:47.054
Aetna we could look at, you
know, some other regional plans.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9589-0
00:46:47.064 --> 00:46:50.652
So it we're not wed to Cigna,
Cigna was just one that we knew

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9589-1
00:46:50.652 --> 00:46:52.794
would have a pretty robust data
set.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9606-0
00:46:52.984 --> 00:46:56.449
So there may be a couple of
other options for sources of

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9599-0
00:46:53.274 --> 00:46:53.454
But.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9606-1
00:46:56.449 --> 00:46:56.814
files.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9614-0
00:46:56.824 --> 00:46:58.614
If we can't get the signal one
resolved.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9616-0
00:46:59.574 --> 00:47:00.724
Absolutely. Absolutely.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9642-0
00:47:00.974 --> 00:47:04.208
I I think the modest, apparently
of whatever we are going to do

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9642-1
00:47:04.208 --> 00:47:06.584
with each of these files is kind
of clear now.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9654-0
00:47:06.694 --> 00:47:08.944
So the the files themselves
might be different.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9661-0
00:47:08.954 --> 00:47:10.744
Like you said, we could probably
accommodate that.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9697-0
00:47:10.834 --> 00:47:14.688
So we will, we will create a
verbiage in our discovery phase

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9697-1
00:47:14.688 --> 00:47:16.204
pause this use use case.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9731-0
00:47:16.214 --> 00:47:19.411
What we are going to do, we'll
share it with the forum here and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9731-1
00:47:19.411 --> 00:47:22.459
maybe in tomorrow's session,
I'll very quickly walk through,

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9731-2
00:47:22.459 --> 00:47:25.556
take 5 minutes about what we are
planning to do as part of an

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9731-3
00:47:25.556 --> 00:47:28.804
outcome for this discovery, for
this particular use case, right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9744-0
00:47:28.814 --> 00:47:31.574
And and then we'll take it
forward from there.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9758-0
00:47:31.644 --> 00:47:35.614
And and and Anthony, I'll shoot
out an email for access for the

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9758-1
00:47:35.614 --> 00:47:36.234
demo data.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9761-0
00:47:36.284 --> 00:47:37.214
Anthony, right.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9789-0
00:47:37.224 --> 00:47:40.559
Like if we are able to pull in
whatever format CSV format, put

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9789-1
00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:43.154
that in S3, we can start
exploring that quickly.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9791-0
00:47:44.634 --> 00:47:45.474
OK, sounds good. Thanks.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9793-0
00:47:46.444 --> 00:47:46.664
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9806-0
00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:50.194
Yeah, David, did anything else
that I had missed at?

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9807-0
00:47:49.764 --> 00:47:50.734
No, I'm good.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9813-0
00:47:53.514 --> 00:47:54.014
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9823-0
00:47:54.134 --> 00:47:54.974
Some sounds good.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9838-0
00:47:54.624 --> 00:47:58.774
Any any inputs from anyone else
David shape Michael.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9832-0
00:47:58.344 --> 00:47:59.094
No, I'm good.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9854-0
00:47:59.104 --> 00:48:02.070
I think I think it was really
good because the right path and

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9853-0
00:48:01.724 --> 00:48:01.904
OK.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9854-1
00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:03.554
then we get some defined scope.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9863-0
00:48:08.474 --> 00:48:08.694
Sure.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9865-0
00:48:08.784 --> 00:48:08.984
Here.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9882-0
00:48:09.774 --> 00:48:13.024
Ashok, Deepika, any other points
that we have to so we've got our

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9882-1
00:48:13.024 --> 00:48:13.664
task cut out.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9895-0
00:48:13.674 --> 00:48:16.454
So we'll we'll work on that and
create the documentation around

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9895-1
00:48:16.454 --> 00:48:16.584
it.

e88747dc-0b91-4639-a8b6-6b8799eef318/9903-0
00:48:16.594 --> 00:48:17.784
