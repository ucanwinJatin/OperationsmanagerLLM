0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:2.610 
Martin clay 
Looks out in findings and we had called with Kartik. 

0:0:2.620 --> 0:0:3.410 
Martin clay 
I know we have. 

0:0:5.50 --> 0:0:5.410 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:0:3.420 --> 0:0:5.910 
Martin clay 
We were supposed to have to make some changes. 

0:0:8.80 --> 0:0:8.270 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:0:10.810 --> 0:0:11.40 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:0:5.920 --> 0:0:12.400 
Martin clay 
We were supposed to have calls with Pamela, but if you wanted to put everything in and then, you know, looking at more things. Yeah. 

0:0:20.730 --> 0:0:21.140 
Tuhin 
Yes. 

0:0:21.670 --> 0:0:21.970 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:0:21.980 --> 0:0:22.520 
Tuhin 
I understand. 

0:0:22.560 --> 0:0:22.840 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:0:12.780 --> 0:0:22.850 
Martin clay 
So this is first one is I think this Karthik can explain better than me that there is actually one is we the pre prod in SQL we don't have data. 

0:0:22.850 --> 0:0:23.340 
Tuhin 
Understand. 

0:0:23.350 --> 0:0:24.360 
Tuhin 
Yeah, I understand. 

0:0:24.370 --> 0:0:27.690 
Tuhin 
I understand the lacking there. 

0:0:28.910 --> 0:0:29.150 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:0:29.160 --> 0:0:30.340 
Martin clay 
So that is one thing. 

0:0:27.700 --> 0:0:30.930 
Tuhin 
Yes, uh yeah. 

0:0:30.560 --> 0:0:39.560 
Martin clay 
And because we are seeing that because of that, I think Q and everything like code is being done and production itself. 

0:0:40.450 --> 0:0:45.650 
Martin clay 
So this is the the which will talk about later. 

0:1:4.430 --> 0:1:4.870 
Tuhin 
So. 

0:0:45.660 --> 0:1:5.500 
Martin clay 
So this is one thing I hope you and this is like we can set up some scripts on the SQL side to have the data scrubbed and you know and have it inside the pre prod or UID whichever is on their skill side so that we can have a separate environment to test it out before we put any code in prod. 

0:1:10.450 --> 0:1:10.750 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:1:8.50 --> 0:1:14.390 
Tuhin 
So Priyanka, you know and you know I'll kind of go on attention then come back to this. 

0:1:14.220 --> 0:1:15.610 
Martin clay 
Hmm, OK. 

0:1:16.690 --> 0:1:25.150 
Tuhin 
I almost wanted to also call this out in the SOW that Anand had shared, right, but I didn't. 

0:1:25.630 --> 0:1:26.600 
Tuhin 
Shame on me. 

0:1:26.670 --> 0:1:29.710 
Tuhin 
I thought about it yesterday to email. 

0:1:29.760 --> 0:1:32.920 
Tuhin 
Ananth, right, the so the. 

0:1:34.500 --> 0:1:40.30 
Tuhin 
I I I I I still want to understand like, you know why this this is important in this scope right now. 

0:1:40.300 --> 0:1:53.230 
Tuhin 
But what I was thinking right, which is a kind of a like a later scope for us, right for fixes in any any existing stuff as well as fixes in. 

0:1:55.520 --> 0:1:58.310 
Tuhin 
Uh, in a in a in a city? 

0:1:58.320 --> 0:1:59.130 
Tuhin 
See context. 

0:1:59.800 --> 0:2:0.150 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:1:59.840 --> 0:2:0.330 
Tuhin 
Priyanka. 

0:2:0.380 --> 0:2:1.70 
Tuhin 
Right, right. 

0:2:1.960 --> 0:2:7.770 
Tuhin 
So this is a thought process that I had because I knew this was going to be an issue, right? 

0:2:7.780 --> 0:2:18.980 
Tuhin 
And in the in the SOW what it was called out that we would make the changes in lower environment and and I understand right because you don't want to change code in production without testing right? 

0:2:19.460 --> 0:2:19.730 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:2:18.990 --> 0:2:22.730 
Tuhin 
Because you may be have to try out approaches and things of that nature. 

0:2:23.810 --> 0:2:27.660 
Tuhin 
So there's essentially 2 concern right from the business point of view, right? 

0:2:35.340 --> 0:2:35.620 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:2:27.670 --> 0:2:35.630 
Tuhin 
One is that as we are changing the code right you know because we don't have a representative data database, right? 

0:2:50.320 --> 0:2:50.560 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:2:36.440 --> 0:2:59.390 
Tuhin 
Where new data ingestions from Astronaut API call or even think about the logic that based on which we generate data right you know maybe .6 paration maybe whatever right there are some system workflow that generates new data right every single day even if the customer doesn't do anything right? 

0:3:0.360 --> 0:3:3.170 
Tuhin 
So those things are going to be less voluminous, right? 

0:3:3.180 --> 0:3:6.160 
Tuhin 
If you go to any environment that's not in production, right? 

0:3:7.410 --> 0:3:7.630 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:3:6.680 --> 0:3:13.690 
Tuhin 
So so I and I was talking to Karthik a little bit as well Karthik here. 

0:3:14.600 --> 0:3:15.890 
Tuhin 
Hey Karthik, thank you for joining. 

0:3:15.900 --> 0:3:16.230 
Tuhin 
Right. 

0:3:18.890 --> 0:3:19.50 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:3:16.380 --> 0:3:25.530 
Tuhin 
So, so we, we we were thinking that what could be like and we just started the conversation back then, right. 

0:3:25.540 --> 0:3:29.160 
Tuhin 
We needed to think about what could be an approach, right. 

0:3:29.890 --> 0:3:37.580 
Tuhin 
Uh, that you know, when we are testing performance or when you are testing like cost of ownership or whatever, right? 

0:3:37.720 --> 0:3:39.330 
Tuhin 
We don't really have a tons of options. 

0:3:40.370 --> 0:3:46.790 
Tuhin 
Uh, in terms of data volume and representation of the current state, which is not production, right? 

0:3:47.80 --> 0:4:0.230 
Tuhin 
So that's the discussion I think me, Karthik and Matt had in the past and I don't think we came to a resolution, but I just wanted to give you give you an idea that we are also internally thinking about it right. 

0:4:0.650 --> 0:4:5.10 
Tuhin 
But from your point of view in the discovery right? 

0:4:5.530 --> 0:4:7.120 
Tuhin 
Why is this finding important? 

0:4:11.530 --> 0:4:12.370 
Karthik Raghu 
And let me take it. 

0:4:9.0 --> 0:4:12.590 
Martin clay 
So you'll see you're going further also. 

0:4:12.680 --> 0:4:13.100 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:4:13.0 --> 0:4:13.180 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:4:13.100 --> 0:4:13.710 
Martin clay 
Yeah, go ahead. 

0:4:13.760 --> 0:4:13.930 
Martin clay 
Go ahead. 

0:4:13.960 --> 0:4:15.630 
Karthik Raghu 
Let me take it so. 

0:4:15.460 --> 0:4:15.670 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:4:20.510 --> 0:4:20.650 
Tuhin 
Yes. 

0:4:15.640 --> 0:4:22.850 
Karthik Raghu 
So actually doing like in we have connected this POC environment right like we can call it as a dev environment 2. 

0:4:22.860 --> 0:4:26.100 
Karthik Raghu 
The 2-3 prod database and then within Preprod you don't. 

0:4:26.110 --> 0:4:28.710 
Karthik Raghu 
They will not be any kind of CDC happening. 

0:4:29.190 --> 0:4:29.410 
Tuhin 
Right. 

0:4:28.720 --> 0:4:31.20 
Karthik Raghu 
I mean like there's no change data, right? 

0:4:31.280 --> 0:4:37.370 
Karthik Raghu 
So what Priyanka is suggesting is like you know, let's not change anything in production. 

0:4:38.880 --> 0:4:39.120 
Tuhin 
Right. 

0:4:37.380 --> 0:4:40.880 
Karthik Raghu 
Let's stick to the plan then we do. 

0:4:40.980 --> 0:4:46.100 
Karthik Raghu 
We thought about like, you know, we discussed about why not just create some scripts. 

0:4:46.860 --> 0:4:47.560 
Karthik Raghu 
Uh. 

0:4:49.830 --> 0:4:50.60 
Tuhin 
Mm-hmm. 

0:4:56.130 --> 0:4:56.370 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:5:10.50 --> 0:5:10.300 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:5:10.350 --> 0:5:15.740 
Karthik Raghu 
We can go ahead and then implement the same thing in production and then see how it behaves in production. 

0:5:16.430 --> 0:5:19.620 
Tuhin 
OK, so which which environment is that? 

0:5:19.630 --> 0:5:20.960 
Tuhin 
PS is gonna be cutting them. 

0:5:22.270 --> 0:5:24.240 
Karthik Raghu 
Right now it is in pre prod. 

0:5:24.250 --> 0:5:29.660 
Karthik Raghu 
I was thinking it was in UAT but looking at so I did a little bit of digging today. 

0:5:30.320 --> 0:5:30.440 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:5:37.840 --> 0:5:38.120 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:5:30.170 --> 0:5:39.720 
Karthik Raghu 
But you know, when we were involved deeply, I think we initially connected it to UAT, but I think later point of time I think Tarang. 

0:5:40.970 --> 0:5:42.50 
Karthik Raghu 
Ohm. 

0:5:43.70 --> 0:5:45.700 
Karthik Raghu 
Umm, started involving more, right? 

0:5:45.710 --> 0:5:53.760 
Karthik Raghu 
So that is when I think they we saw some differences between the schema of UAT database and then production. 

0:5:54.270 --> 0:5:56.910 
Karthik Raghu 
So it is different, right? 

0:5:54.110 --> 0:5:57.440 
Tuhin 
Yes, it is different because they're right. 

0:5:57.490 --> 0:5:58.660 
Tuhin 
Yes, yeah. 

0:5:56.920 --> 0:6:4.810 
Karthik Raghu 
So yeah, so preproduction is, is, is has the exact copy of production, right? 

0:6:4.820 --> 0:6:6.370 
Karthik Raghu 
So we are maintaining that. 

0:6:6.900 --> 0:6:10.870 
Karthik Raghu 
So we took the production pre production for UAT. 

0:6:13.200 --> 0:6:14.70 
Tuhin 
Reproduction. 

0:6:13.570 --> 0:6:21.280 
Karthik Raghu 
Sorry, not UAT, but what the for the POC like I think for the lower environment it's going like it's connecting to the preproduction database. 

0:6:21.290 --> 0:6:26.220 
Karthik Raghu 
Preproduction is what we use for our CI CD pipeline as the pre prod. 

0:6:27.90 --> 0:6:31.380 
Tuhin 
OK, so how is that team pushing code? 

0:6:31.390 --> 0:6:36.270 
Tuhin 
Current Team Databricks team right pushing codes in production at the coding directly in production? 

0:6:36.280 --> 0:6:39.330 
Tuhin 
Or are they doing it in lower environment first than promoting it? 

0:6:39.580 --> 0:6:48.990 
Karthik Raghu 
I I don't know, but I don't think they're actively using preproduction because of the fact that there is no new data coming in, right? 

0:6:50.370 --> 0:6:50.580 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:6:53.950 --> 0:6:54.190 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:6:49.0 --> 0:7:1.860 
Karthik Raghu 
So just for that sake, they started doing stuff in production, but the but The thing is ohm, you know the code is all messed up. 

0:7:1.870 --> 0:7:4.940 
Karthik Raghu 
Like you know the names, everything right? 

0:7:4.950 --> 0:7:9.110 
Karthik Raghu 
Like even if it is set up on the lower environment, data breaks lower environment. 

0:7:10.270 --> 0:7:19.880 
Karthik Raghu 
The all the names, everything is like, you know, just pointing something like US prod DB, all the variables, everything is pointing towards the like it it sends. 

0:7:20.130 --> 0:7:25.950 
Karthik Raghu 
It seems as if it is kind of connecting to production, but it is not. 

0:7:25.960 --> 0:7:27.760 
Karthik Raghu 
Actually it is connecting to. 

0:7:27.850 --> 0:7:29.640 
Karthik Raghu 
You know, it just the names are being changed. 

0:7:29.650 --> 0:7:31.640 
Karthik Raghu 
That variable names are kept as it is. 

0:7:37.620 --> 0:7:37.920 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:7:31.650 --> 0:7:39.40 
Karthik Raghu 
I think for some reason he chose not to, you know, separate the names actually. 

0:7:39.90 --> 0:7:42.730 
Karthik Raghu 
So that created a little confusion to Priyanka. 

0:7:42.740 --> 0:7:44.610 
Karthik Raghu 
It seems so. 

0:7:44.540 --> 0:7:44.780 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:7:44.680 --> 0:8:9.310 
Karthik Raghu 
That thing is so I just checked this afternoon and then realized that, OK, this is still pointing to preproduction, but the names are everything that is being used within the code sounds as if it is like production because I think he would have done something in like production directly and then copy the same notebook and then just paste it the same thing, same code in the lower environment. 

0:8:9.800 --> 0:8:10.40 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:8:9.320 --> 0:8:10.440 
Karthik Raghu 
That is what I'm assuming. 

0:8:11.160 --> 0:8:18.330 
Karthik Raghu 
OK, so I think right now they the like maybe from the from the database standpoint. 

0:8:18.340 --> 0:8:29.860 
Karthik Raghu 
I think Priyanka can give her give more, you know, insights as to how the data is being, you know captured like basically into into the layers different, all different kinds of layers. 

0:8:30.940 --> 0:8:31.140 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:8:32.190 --> 0:8:34.500 
Martin clay 
So that is also one of the concerns, right? 

0:8:34.650 --> 0:8:36.690 
Martin clay 
When I come, I agree with Karthik. 

0:8:36.700 --> 0:8:40.160 
Martin clay 
Whatever he said, actually, that is what we were discussing earlier in the day also. 

0:8:40.570 --> 0:8:55.340 
Martin clay 
And and why I wanted to go through all these is because one question, one thing that I've been seeing a partners, I admit this is what I'm this is purpose of it got confusing because if you see this is the POC and we have the workspace right. 

0:8:55.880 --> 0:8:56.90 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:8:55.380 --> 0:8:57.10 
Martin clay 
So the code does not match. 

0:8:57.20 --> 0:9:3.570 
Martin clay 
We had to actually me and Rupali had to one or two scripts we had to copy from here and put it back in unity. 

0:9:5.570 --> 0:9:5.790 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:9:3.630 --> 0:9:19.110 
Martin clay 
So in Dev so that one concern that Karthik brought up is pointing to the data, other one is and this is I have already put in the code is being tested out in although it's running like you know on connecting to pre prod right? 

0:9:19.840 --> 0:9:20.100 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:9:19.370 --> 0:9:36.590 
Martin clay 
But the code itself is being tested here because there's no option of testing on and I understand that concern from, you know, from somebody who's running there and there's no data, because although we call it CDC, this current date, if you see the current this thing, it's incremental, right? 

0:9:47.580 --> 0:9:47.870 
Tuhin 
Right. 

0:9:36.780 --> 0:9:49.30 
Martin clay 
It's not batch load that we were doing that OK, we have the entire bunch bag or we just change it is actually checking for change data capture or delta capture actually CDC we call it when it's the real time. 

0:9:49.770 --> 0:9:49.950 
Tuhin 
Right. 

0:9:49.430 --> 0:9:50.540 
Martin clay 
But here it's delta. 

0:9:56.710 --> 0:9:56.920 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:9:50.630 --> 0:9:58.0 
Martin clay 
It's trying to get delta and that is I think also if you see and you'll see the difference between the codes in upper environment and lower environment. 

0:9:58.960 --> 0:9:59.190 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:9:58.390 --> 0:10:7.930 
Martin clay 
So they are being changed here and maybe there were concerns on some restrictions, that's why this caused this. 

0:10:10.490 --> 0:10:11.120 
Tuhin 
Yeah. OK. 

0:10:7.940 --> 0:10:13.960 
Martin clay 
I called out before starting anything else because I see that this has become one of the reasons of all these things. 

0:10:14.680 --> 0:10:16.410 
Tuhin 
OK, alright. 

0:10:16.630 --> 0:10:16.810 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:10:16.620 --> 0:10:18.450 
Tuhin 
Let's then run through the findings. 

0:10:19.120 --> 0:10:19.440 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:10:18.500 --> 0:10:21.570 
Tuhin 
So thank you for explaining that solution. 

0:10:21.580 --> 0:10:24.170 
Tuhin 
We can talk later, but let's run through all the yeah. 

0:10:23.350 --> 0:10:28.930 
Martin clay 
Yeah, the that is also I'm thinking let's run through the findings and then we can talk about Solutioning, right. 

0:10:29.120 --> 0:10:29.260 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:10:29.130 --> 0:10:34.680 
Martin clay 
So other thing and this also again I go back to this point, the cluster, right. 

0:10:34.790 --> 0:10:42.250 
Martin clay 
So what we have we have put screenshots to the clusters are running 24 by 7 right and they are two type of clusters that they're using. 

0:10:42.260 --> 0:10:44.780 
Martin clay 
That is, that is being used right now and annex. 

0:10:44.790 --> 0:10:48.920 
Martin clay 
That is, one is the all purpose and one is the job compute right? 

0:10:49.390 --> 0:10:49.590 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:10:49.170 --> 0:10:52.20 
Martin clay 
And job compute there is. 

0:10:52.890 --> 0:10:53.820 
Martin clay 
I'll come back to that. 

0:10:53.830 --> 0:10:58.850 
Martin clay 
But the one thing is we can reduce the time based on the peak hours that is being used. 

0:10:59.300 --> 0:11:0.830 
Martin clay 
It doesn't have to be up and running. 

0:11:0.840 --> 0:11:10.10 
Martin clay 
The All purpose cluster second is, as I mentioned earlier also, and we have put the screenshots here that last 30 days in POC itself. 

0:11:10.20 --> 0:11:12.270 
Martin clay 
What we saw that is the Max you can see right? 

0:11:16.330 --> 0:11:16.590 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:11:12.540 --> 0:11:19.270 
Martin clay 
It's only using Max 10 to 12% of the current GPU, so this is one thing that we have talked to Karthik and Vemula. 

0:11:19.280 --> 0:11:26.140 
Martin clay 
We'll work together and we'll introduce the this thing and see if it affects, but so this I'm I'm now. 

0:11:26.150 --> 0:11:28.20 
Martin clay 
Once we do it here, I'm again. 

0:11:28.30 --> 0:11:32.950 
Martin clay 
I go back to that are lacking in the data or the load or running continuously write that week. 

0:11:32.160 --> 0:11:34.880 
Tuhin 
But it lame so you can. 

0:11:36.860 --> 0:11:37.160 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:11:34.960 --> 0:11:39.140 
Tuhin 
Can I just make two comments about the CPU stuff right as a as a layperson? 

0:11:40.340 --> 0:11:40.550 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:11:40.210 --> 0:11:48.260 
Tuhin 
So when you say that we are running CPU 24 by 7 and the utilization is between 10 and 12%, right? 

0:11:49.40 --> 0:11:49.290 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:11:52.160 --> 0:11:52.410 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:11:48.270 --> 0:11:55.830 
Tuhin 
If you ask me if I look at the cost calculation without knowing anything technical details right, there are two things we can do, right? 

0:11:56.20 --> 0:11:56.250 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:11:56.150 --> 0:12:0.410 
Tuhin 
Maybe we are running a more powerful core. 

0:12:1.260 --> 0:12:2.140 
Martin clay 
Yes it is. 

0:12:5.370 --> 0:12:5.510 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:12:0.420 --> 0:12:7.430 
Tuhin 
I don't know if they have a they and then we reduce it then thereby it reduces the price. 

0:12:7.440 --> 0:12:14.130 
Tuhin 
Or maybe we are running lot more and we reduce the number even if we have to keep it 24/7, that should still like. 

0:12:14.720 --> 0:12:15.890 
Martin clay 
Yes, exactly. 

0:12:15.900 --> 0:12:16.760 
Martin clay 
No, no, I agree. 

0:12:19.190 --> 0:12:19.670 
Martin clay 
Yes you are. 

0:12:20.610 --> 0:12:21.100 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:12:14.140 --> 0:12:21.440 
Tuhin 
I'm saying even if right the right am I on the right track on the OK, OK, OK. 

0:12:21.200 --> 0:12:21.610 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:12:21.620 --> 0:12:25.830 
Karthik Raghu 
So the typically I think what she's talking about is doing. 

0:12:26.600 --> 0:12:26.750 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:12:30.590 --> 0:12:30.770 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:12:30.880 --> 0:12:31.150 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:12:37.560 --> 0:12:37.760 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:12:38.710 --> 0:12:38.850 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:12:26.920 --> 0:12:40.30 
Karthik Raghu 
I think there are certain tweaks within the data breaks ohm that we we can make like I think she's more or like talking about the workers like which are actually responsible for providing the enough compute power. 

0:12:40.40 --> 0:12:40.410 
Karthik Raghu 
Right. 

0:12:40.960 --> 0:12:41.300 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:12:40.660 --> 0:12:46.400 
Karthik Raghu 
So those need not be running all the time like it we have to tweak as per our schedule. 

0:12:46.410 --> 0:12:52.160 
Karthik Raghu 
Like you know, maybe we'll say like, you know, this is my peak time and then this is when I need this number of servers. 

0:12:52.950 --> 0:12:53.850 
Tuhin 
OK. Yeah. 

0:12:53.360 --> 0:12:55.210 
Karthik Raghu 
Like there's a lot, all kinds of, you know. 

0:12:55.820 --> 0:12:56.430 
Tuhin 
Configuration. 

0:12:56.440 --> 0:12:56.730 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:12:57.620 --> 0:12:57.810 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:12:56.800 --> 0:12:58.550 
Tuhin 
Yeah. OK. 

0:12:55.910 --> 0:13:1.200 
Karthik Raghu 
Umm that can be done within the data breaks, so that is what he's referring to. 

0:13:1.610 --> 0:13:1.850 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:13:1.530 --> 0:13:6.200 
Karthik Raghu 
But at least for the POC, what he's doing is like maybe we'll run overnight jobs. 

0:13:6.790 --> 0:13:6.990 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:13:10.370 --> 0:13:10.690 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:13:6.990 --> 0:13:10.730 
Karthik Raghu 
Uh to like for for the CDC, right. 

0:13:19.680 --> 0:13:19.920 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:13:29.0 --> 0:13:29.200 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:13:10.830 --> 0:13:29.600 
Karthik Raghu 
So and then probably just try to reduce it for now, maybe maybe for production, we might do the same thing, but it will be more frequent like you know for US it like during morning times we'll have a 5 workers running instead of you know, two workers during night times. 

0:13:29.610 --> 0:13:33.340 
Karthik Raghu 
We'll just have two workers running, and then even within the worker. 

0:13:33.350 --> 0:13:41.860 
Karthik Raghu 
Also, what she's suggesting is there are certain settings within the what you say no within the data breaks itself. 

0:13:42.320 --> 0:13:42.500 
Tuhin 
Mm-hmm. 

0:13:48.60 --> 0:13:48.320 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:13:42.530 --> 0:13:51.400 
Karthik Raghu 
To configure that in such a way that part processing is also, you know we also consider parallelly processing the data. 

0:13:53.810 --> 0:13:54.10 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:13:51.590 --> 0:13:56.490 
Karthik Raghu 
So these are all the I think areas that she's is referring to. 

0:13:57.170 --> 0:13:57.400 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:13:58.500 --> 0:13:58.720 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:13:58.990 --> 0:14:0.970 
Karthik Raghu 
Like nothing conclusive, right as of now, right. 

0:14:0.750 --> 0:14:1.490 
Tuhin 
OK, OK. 

0:14:0.980 --> 0:14:3.960 
Karthik Raghu 
Like I think there are a lot of stuff that we can do based on our schedule. 

0:14:5.860 --> 0:14:6.30 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:14:3.970 --> 0:14:6.550 
Karthik Raghu 
When do we want the data to be updated? 

0:14:6.630 --> 0:14:7.510 
Karthik Raghu 
So stuff like that. 

0:14:8.650 --> 0:14:9.550 
Tuhin 
OK, alright. 

0:14:9.560 --> 0:14:13.500 
Tuhin 
That sounds good and I'm, I'm sure like you know, there is other strategies too, right? 

0:14:13.510 --> 0:14:16.820 
Tuhin 
You know, if there is, like if we can pin down times, right. 

0:14:17.90 --> 0:14:17.240 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:14:18.960 --> 0:14:19.130 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:14:16.830 --> 0:14:21.900 
Tuhin 
You know, we can look into some sort of auto scaling to kick in and all of that kind of stuff, right? 

0:14:21.910 --> 0:14:22.870 
Tuhin 
We can we can look into that. 

0:14:22.990 --> 0:14:23.810 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:14:23.530 --> 0:14:23.960 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:14:23.90 --> 0:14:24.760 
Tuhin 
I'm guessing yeah. 

0:14:27.60 --> 0:14:27.240 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:14:23.970 --> 0:14:27.570 
Martin clay 
Actually yes, actually doing there are two three things as Karthick mentioned right. 

0:14:27.580 --> 0:14:29.160 
Martin clay 
One is 1 is the code right? 

0:14:29.170 --> 0:14:31.160 
Martin clay 
We are reducing the core one is scheduling. 

0:14:31.170 --> 0:14:36.660 
Martin clay 
We don't need to to stop the server, but it's like after hours we can have it come up later. 

0:14:36.710 --> 0:14:44.200 
Martin clay 
Other thing that and that is in the suggestion itself that creating a pool so that certain jobs, we know that this is the this is the requirement. 

0:14:44.210 --> 0:14:45.940 
Martin clay 
So certain jobs are priority, right? 

0:14:46.340 --> 0:14:46.540 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:14:46.210 --> 0:14:49.350 
Martin clay 
That we can give it more out of that pool, we can give them more. 

0:14:54.30 --> 0:14:54.290 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:14:49.360 --> 0:14:56.440 
Martin clay 
What happens when we don't put the pool is anything that's running that takes everything and then other ones get delayed, right? 

0:14:56.510 --> 0:14:56.730 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:14:56.550 --> 0:14:59.940 
Martin clay 
So in and because we do have those cores right? 

0:14:59.950 --> 0:15:2.380 
Martin clay 
And it's not being used completely. 

0:15:2.510 --> 0:15:6.520 
Martin clay 
We can actually configure it in the configurations in the code also. 

0:15:6.580 --> 0:15:6.760 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:15:11.630 --> 0:15:11.830 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:15:15.480 --> 0:15:15.640 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:15:15.700 --> 0:15:17.430 
Martin clay 
And you can keep them to what? 

0:15:17.600 --> 0:15:18.490 
Martin clay 
The pool does it. 

0:15:24.240 --> 0:15:24.460 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:15:18.500 --> 0:15:28.250 
Martin clay 
If the second job runs and two systems are already running and they have CPU, they'll run on the same one rather than bringing up another one worker, right? 

0:15:28.290 --> 0:15:29.60 
Tuhin 
Ohh OK. 

0:15:28.400 --> 0:15:44.410 
Martin clay 
So this this is like the this I think is common and I think you and Karthik will come into that and in data bricks itself, one thing that I would say I saw different from the POC that we did 2-3 things is in which is cost and performance differences. 

0:15:44.560 --> 0:15:47.420 
Martin clay 
One the all the tables are being called in one job, right? 

0:15:48.40 --> 0:15:48.240 
Tuhin 
Hmm. 

0:15:47.920 --> 0:15:53.950 
Martin clay 
And that is running, so it's not actually distributing the load, although we have so many cores running so that is. 

0:15:54.0 --> 0:15:54.950 
Martin clay 
I know it might. 

0:15:54.960 --> 0:15:58.950 
Martin clay 
They might have used it for the performance, but that needs to be refactored. 

0:15:58.960 --> 0:16:1.210 
Martin clay 
One thing uh, that can help it out. 

0:16:5.650 --> 0:16:5.920 
Martin clay 
So. 

0:16:10.420 --> 0:16:10.640 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:16:1.310 --> 0:16:10.850 
Karthik Raghu 
I know I kind of know of like, you know, I think they started increasing the core when they saw some kind of delays in getting the data. 

0:16:10.910 --> 0:16:12.810 
Karthik Raghu 
Priyanka, that's what I remember. 

0:16:13.90 --> 0:16:13.240 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:16:12.860 --> 0:16:14.870 
Karthik Raghu 
I asked Tarang, I reply. 

0:16:14.880 --> 0:16:21.850 
Karthik Raghu 
I asked Tarang like, you know, if you keep on increasing it like without optimization, it might not help, right? 

0:16:22.810 --> 0:16:24.240 
Martin clay 
Yes, and it did not help. 

0:16:21.860 --> 0:16:25.440 
Karthik Raghu 
Like then I think they were still searching. 

0:16:24.250 --> 0:16:26.300 
Martin clay 
Actually, that is what we got. 

0:16:30.300 --> 0:16:30.450 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:16:34.240 --> 0:16:34.550 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:16:26.370 --> 0:16:37.440 
Martin clay 
It did not give them any help, so those and that is why I think we can go ahead and start reducing them, right the what we got the input is that performance did not increase when creating the core. 

0:16:37.450 --> 0:16:38.180 
Martin clay 
And I can see why. 

0:16:46.480 --> 0:16:46.660 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:16:38.190 --> 0:16:48.140 
Martin clay 
And that's why I'm saying a lot of code refactoring we can do where we can have parallel jobs running in the same task, and you know they can run through and they use the same code. 

0:16:48.250 --> 0:17:1.980 
Martin clay 
And one major problem I'm seeing right now, and this is the other one, jobs are very you know and how they have configured that is again going back to the code lower environment to higher environment, it's different but different environments. 

0:17:1.990 --> 0:17:7.500 
Martin clay 
Maybe it's a requirement from your side, but the job task is how scheduling is done is very different, right? 

0:17:7.570 --> 0:17:11.560 
Martin clay 
Although they're running continuously, so we feel a lot of failing of the jobs. 

0:17:17.950 --> 0:17:18.150 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:17:11.570 --> 0:17:19.280 
Martin clay 
And then you that is also causing that we can avoid that if we have time limits and we put them for now, right. 

0:17:22.710 --> 0:17:22.850 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:17:26.120 --> 0:17:26.420 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:17:19.290 --> 0:17:27.510 
Martin clay 
And that might also be causing data quality issue because we ran one of the jobs as it is because if you notice I wanted to bring that up. 

0:17:27.850 --> 0:17:31.180 
Martin clay 
Ohh if you see your this is the problem. 

0:17:31.270 --> 0:17:32.340 
Martin clay 
No, this is POC. 

0:17:32.470 --> 0:17:39.370 
Martin clay 
Ohh go to the if you this is the current situation and this is the U right. 

0:17:40.170 --> 0:17:50.160 
Martin clay 
So if you see your job, one is running, but all of them in a day in one time itself turned 30 PM, 70 runs have been skipped and 26 runs succeeded. 

0:17:50.310 --> 0:17:57.860 
Martin clay 
And once once the stops concurrently and you have facing concurrency problems because that is not configured inside the code and configuration. 

0:17:58.330 --> 0:18:6.290 
Martin clay 
So we have the codes but we are not using them and it's second thing is the possibility can only be done when we change the job configuration, right? 

0:18:7.50 --> 0:18:7.290 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:18:9.100 --> 0:18:9.340 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:18:6.300 --> 0:18:15.360 
Martin clay 
The how we are fetching the data up in parallel so concurrencies when issue as this is all I I feel like this is all tied back to again the same thing right? 

0:18:15.830 --> 0:18:16.30 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:18:15.370 --> 0:18:18.30 
Martin clay 
This is causing performance and costing. 

0:18:19.0 --> 0:18:19.220 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:18:20.250 --> 0:18:29.390 
Martin clay 
So this I wanted to check because you know different regions, different environments, the code, the jobs are different and the code is different. 

0:18:27.740 --> 0:18:30.210 
Tuhin 
Umm yeah. 

0:18:29.860 --> 0:18:32.830 
Martin clay 
Is there specific reason for that for the gold layer? 

0:18:32.840 --> 0:18:38.660 
Martin clay 
I understand I'm talking about like the bronze layer and everything is that they're specific reason that. 

0:18:37.770 --> 0:18:40.500 
Tuhin 
So what do you mean like different tasks, right? 

0:18:40.680 --> 0:18:40.930 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:18:43.270 --> 0:18:43.500 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:18:41.390 --> 0:18:46.340 
Tuhin 
Without going into detail, can you mean by what do you mean by different tasks? 

0:18:46.350 --> 0:18:48.270 
Tuhin 
Are they pulling different? Yeah. 

0:18:46.410 --> 0:18:48.860 
Martin clay 
Task means uh, no. 

0:18:48.910 --> 0:18:49.280 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:18:49.290 --> 0:18:51.90 
Martin clay 
So for example, let's take the simple one. 

0:18:51.520 --> 0:18:51.680 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:18:51.130 --> 0:18:54.0 
Martin clay 
Let's say the one that POC was done right? 

0:18:54.240 --> 0:18:54.410 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:18:54.70 --> 0:18:58.370 
Martin clay 
So from you are taking it from my SQL right now you're taking from AWS, right? 

0:19:0.250 --> 0:19:0.390 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:18:58.380 --> 0:19:1.850 
Martin clay 
So Aww is to bronze and bronze to silver and silver to master. 

0:19:3.280 --> 0:19:3.440 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:19:1.860 --> 0:19:4.220 
Martin clay 
That is what we have in the bronze master. 

0:19:4.270 --> 0:19:10.340 
Martin clay 
There is one job that has been scheduled where bronze will fetch the data, then silver will get it, then gold will get it. 

0:19:10.890 --> 0:19:11.40 
Tuhin 
Right. 

0:19:10.450 --> 0:19:14.200 
Martin clay 
In another reason there is only Browns getting the data, nothing else. 

0:19:14.710 --> 0:19:17.510 
Martin clay 
So that is. 

0:19:17.20 --> 0:19:18.10 
Tuhin 
What region is that? 

0:19:18.20 --> 0:19:18.440 
Tuhin 
Do you know? 

0:19:18.640 --> 0:19:21.220 
Tuhin 
Do you know top of your head or no? Yeah. 

0:19:19.40 --> 0:19:24.450 
Martin clay 
Yeah, I because yes, yes, you reach because I looked at that, This Is Us region, right? 

0:19:24.540 --> 0:19:25.860 
Martin clay 
So if you look at the jobs. 

0:19:25.400 --> 0:19:27.500 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, you could be incomplete worker. 

0:19:28.110 --> 0:19:28.800 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:19:27.830 --> 0:19:29.80 
Tuhin 
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. 

0:19:29.90 --> 0:19:29.530 
Tuhin 
That's what I'm. 

0:19:27.510 --> 0:19:29.850 
Karthik Raghu 
Priyanka, that's what I can guess. 

0:19:29.290 --> 0:19:29.860 
Martin clay 
Yeah, I'm. 

0:19:29.870 --> 0:19:31.310 
Martin clay 
I'm just, yeah. 

0:19:30.680 --> 0:19:32.270 
Karthik Raghu 
It's just still work in progress. 

0:19:34.800 --> 0:19:35.40 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:19:37.210 --> 0:19:37.560 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:19:40.570 --> 0:19:40.790 
Martin clay 
So. 

0:19:32.280 --> 0:19:42.420 
Karthik Raghu 
I think the most of the, I think even the US region, I think there's a lot of areas that the team is working on, you know, so most of it is like you know, work in progress. 

0:19:43.260 --> 0:19:43.810 
Martin clay 
OK. 

0:19:43.930 --> 0:19:44.70 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:19:43.820 --> 0:19:56.340 
Martin clay 
And that is one question I had is because we we were analyzing and one issue we are having is when we are analyzing we figure out one thing and we start going and then there are changes made to the schedule as well as jobs. 

0:19:57.0 --> 0:19:57.140 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:19:58.990 --> 0:19:59.210 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:20:2.730 --> 0:20:3.20 
Tuhin 
Welcome. 

0:19:56.350 --> 0:20:4.70 
Martin clay 
So, uh, that then we are back to zero that I that. 

0:20:6.800 --> 0:20:7.20 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:20:9.790 --> 0:20:10.70 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:20:3.250 --> 0:20:11.110 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, but if we check with Tarang like when you had this, uh, OK, like, you know, meeting right like that Katie meeting with them. 

0:20:11.860 --> 0:20:12.230 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:20:11.570 --> 0:20:12.540 
Karthik Raghu 
Did you check with him? 

0:20:12.550 --> 0:20:13.240 
Karthik Raghu 
Like why? 

0:20:13.310 --> 0:20:14.920 
Karthik Raghu 
What is the reason behind it? 

0:20:15.10 --> 0:20:19.100 
Karthik Raghu 
Like you know why he has a like, what kind of work is still in progress? 

0:20:19.110 --> 0:20:20.640 
Karthik Raghu 
What kind of work is still? 

0:20:22.410 --> 0:20:22.610 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:20:20.840 --> 0:20:23.930 
Karthik Raghu 
I think I I'm I'm I know that there are certain areas that are done. 

0:20:23.830 --> 0:20:25.230 
Martin clay 
Hmm. Hmm. 

0:20:24.860 --> 0:20:28.130 
Karthik Raghu 
Uh for US, but the rest of them? 

0:20:28.140 --> 0:20:36.590 
Karthik Raghu 
I think maybe should have been left behind, or maybe it's still work in progress that that I think Tarang should be able to provide that info. 

0:20:36.600 --> 0:20:37.40 
Karthik Raghu 
We don't know. 

0:20:36.960 --> 0:20:37.290 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:20:37.300 --> 0:20:38.150 
Martin clay 
And and no. 

0:20:38.160 --> 0:20:38.710 
Martin clay 
No, exactly. 

0:20:38.720 --> 0:20:43.410 
Martin clay 
And and I think tomorrow we are scheduling a call with them to get this information. 

0:20:43.820 --> 0:20:48.130 
Martin clay 
But and I think maybe it's a standard procedure how we work. 

0:20:48.140 --> 0:20:57.930 
Martin clay 
So our understanding was we started with the POC, we took one of the code from this and we put it there, pointing it to the dev only and then we. 

0:20:58.530 --> 0:21:7.750 
Martin clay 
Each does this code that was built can be done anywhere except just the parameters for so you understand the confusion I'm having. 

0:21:7.760 --> 0:21:8.290 
Martin clay 
Why? 

0:21:8.300 --> 0:21:13.770 
Martin clay 
I'm bringing up a biz because the code is same everywhere it's fetching from the same database. 

0:21:13.780 --> 0:21:19.120 
Martin clay 
Is my understanding correct or am I assuming and definitely Tarang has been happening, no. 

0:21:22.980 --> 0:21:23.270 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:21:17.550 --> 0:21:24.600 
Karthik Raghu 
As far as I know, I I as far as I know, I think it might not be the case. 

0:21:30.210 --> 0:21:30.480 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:21:25.410 --> 0:21:36.820 
Karthik Raghu 
I do not know like whether things have changed recently, because I think we like we are not in the loop when they're like working anything data bricks, right? 

0:21:37.570 --> 0:21:38.30 
Martin clay 
OK, OK. 

0:21:37.130 --> 0:21:42.380 
Karthik Raghu 
We are never in the loop, so there are certain areas, yeah. 

0:21:40.340 --> 0:21:43.120 
Tuhin 
So when you yeah, go ahead. 

0:21:43.130 --> 0:21:43.440 
Tuhin 
Good. 

0:21:47.110 --> 0:21:47.370 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:21:43.480 --> 0:21:47.950 
Tuhin 
When you said the same same database, what do you mean the? 

0:21:48.60 --> 0:21:50.70 
Tuhin 
Maybe I can try to help answer the question. 

0:21:50.400 --> 0:21:57.880 
Martin clay 
So is it the same structure and same fetching of the like the same logic, at least for the layers that you're going through, right? 

0:21:58.620 --> 0:21:59.260 
Tuhin 
Uh. 

0:21:57.890 --> 0:22:5.160 
Martin clay 
The like simple thing is taking the data from bronze, taking the data from the SQL to bronze to you know, then putting it into silver. 

0:22:5.170 --> 0:22:6.610 
Martin clay 
Maybe the gold master can be different. 

0:22:6.620 --> 0:22:7.600 
Martin clay 
I understand that right? 

0:22:7.40 --> 0:22:12.900 
Tuhin 
I no not them should really be different from a business point of view. 

0:22:14.180 --> 0:22:14.490 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:22:14.440 --> 0:22:15.790 
Karthik Raghu 
Yes, absolutely. 

0:22:12.910 --> 0:22:16.220 
Tuhin 
If you asked me and Karthik here, you'll have to correct me here. 

0:22:15.800 --> 0:22:16.430 
Karthik Raghu 
Absolutely. 

0:22:16.310 --> 0:22:17.650 
Tuhin 
Right because. 

0:22:16.440 --> 0:22:18.150 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. 

0:22:18.160 --> 0:22:19.390 
Karthik Raghu 
They should not be different. 

0:22:19.790 --> 0:22:19.950 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:22:23.790 --> 0:22:23.970 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:22:19.530 --> 0:22:26.220 
Karthik Raghu 
Code is same, database schema is same even if we have different regions the data would differ but the schema will still be the same. 

0:22:27.320 --> 0:22:27.670 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:22:27.600 --> 0:22:27.820 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:22:27.240 --> 0:22:29.430 
Karthik Raghu 
So I don't see, yeah. 

0:22:31.540 --> 0:22:31.760 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:22:33.870 --> 0:22:34.90 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:22:27.680 --> 0:22:37.930 
Tuhin 
So the report that I see in EU versus a report that I see in AP versus report that I see in, in a region, has no qualitative difference, right? 

0:22:38.510 --> 0:22:38.810 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:22:38.40 --> 0:22:40.870 
Tuhin 
Yeah, the sites have configuration difference whatever, right? 

0:22:40.880 --> 0:22:42.860 
Tuhin 
But that should be in the pipeline itself, right? 

0:22:43.950 --> 0:22:44.740 
Tuhin 
Only. 

0:22:45.150 --> 0:22:45.600 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:22:40.690 --> 0:22:46.20 
Martin clay 
Hmm, exactly that is a yeah. 

0:22:45.650 --> 0:22:49.540 
Tuhin 
Only thing that you may see different in the EU server. 

0:22:50.490 --> 0:22:50.740 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:22:54.190 --> 0:22:54.420 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:22:50.990 --> 0:22:56.580 
Tuhin 
The If you see reference to Harrods right, we had to do something custom for Harrods. 

0:22:57.180 --> 0:22:57.590 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:23:1.830 --> 0:23:2.230 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:22:56.670 --> 0:23:4.200 
Tuhin 
But you may see one or two pipeline in for Harrods and even in my opinion in that case, right? 

0:23:7.770 --> 0:23:8.50 
Martin clay 
So. 

0:23:4.210 --> 0:23:9.760 
Tuhin 
My my opinion like Lehman without knowing code even in that case right? 

0:23:17.360 --> 0:23:18.660 
Martin clay 
Hmm. Yes. 

0:23:9.970 --> 0:23:21.590 
Tuhin 
That should have been taken care of by just because the silver and bronze Ware, depending on how we set it up, even in you shouldn't have been different even for Harrods, right? 

0:23:21.960 --> 0:23:22.200 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:23:26.530 --> 0:23:26.760 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:23:21.880 --> 0:23:30.710 
Tuhin 
Because what errors is essentially asking for they wanted two API right out of databricks to pull larger amount of data to a third party system, right? 

0:23:33.810 --> 0:23:34.30 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:23:30.820 --> 0:23:35.770 
Tuhin 
And those API had to be configured so the configured part of their specification. 

0:23:38.290 --> 0:23:38.520 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:23:35.980 --> 0:23:43.780 
Tuhin 
So if you ask me right, the data has to be the same, at least from SQL to whatever layer it's going to right? 

0:23:43.840 --> 0:23:46.170 
Tuhin 
Then maybe you have another notebook. 

0:23:46.180 --> 0:23:48.980 
Tuhin 
That's that's building the headers API right? 

0:23:49.0 --> 0:23:49.450 
Martin clay 
Exactly. 

0:23:49.170 --> 0:23:50.450 
Tuhin 
But right. 

0:23:51.410 --> 0:23:51.630 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:23:50.900 --> 0:23:58.250 
Tuhin 
Uh, but it there shouldn't be a qualitative difference between like, you know how the data is getting fetched and whatnot, in my opinion. 

0:23:58.460 --> 0:23:58.730 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:24:3.500 --> 0:24:3.770 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:23:58.840 --> 0:24:3.970 
Tuhin 
Sorry Karthik, I don't know if you wanted to add anything, but that's kind of like my understanding of how we work. 

0:24:3.780 --> 0:24:4.330 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, that's true. 

0:24:4.20 --> 0:24:5.470 
Tuhin 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:24:6.780 --> 0:24:11.800 
Martin clay 
So exactly that that is what my understanding was from earlier. 

0:24:12.720 --> 0:24:12.880 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:24:28.330 --> 0:24:28.580 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:24:12.100 --> 0:24:34.640 
Martin clay 
You know, when we worked on this and that's why because the court should be done and I understand, as I said, there is, uh, you know, testing issues and all, but the code itself is being different in different regions and that is that is causing a lot of it should not be that way and that is causing a lot of confusion definitely. 

0:24:35.210 --> 0:24:41.880 
Karthik Raghu 
So yeah, that's what right Priyanka, I think maybe this is the right forum to ask right? 

0:24:42.370 --> 0:24:42.650 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:24:41.890 --> 0:24:43.790 
Karthik Raghu 
Like whatever we had discussed in the afternoon. 

0:24:44.670 --> 0:24:45.20 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:24:47.30 --> 0:24:47.280 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:24:52.370 --> 0:24:52.610 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:24:58.660 --> 0:24:58.990 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:24:45.40 --> 0:25:4.920 
Karthik Raghu 
Like, do you really think that, you know, you wanna just go through whatever is done on the POC, that workspace you want to just go through all the notebooks or like all the code and then you want to provide a recommendation or you want to provide a generic recommendation and then just start clean? 

0:25:4.930 --> 0:25:5.460 
Karthik Raghu 
I don't know. 

0:25:5.470 --> 0:25:6.340 
Karthik Raghu 
Like how? 

0:25:6.550 --> 0:25:8.640 
Karthik Raghu 
Like yeah. 

0:25:6.610 --> 0:25:9.150 
Martin clay 
Actually, yeah, yeah, I would. 

0:25:8.650 --> 0:25:9.240 
Karthik Raghu 
So I got. 

0:25:9.280 --> 0:25:10.580 
Karthik Raghu 
Maybe that is the correct right? 

0:25:11.930 --> 0:25:12.120 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:25:10.590 --> 0:25:13.200 
Karthik Raghu 
This is the right forum because twin is there in this call, right? 

0:25:13.610 --> 0:25:16.460 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, maybe you need to get that clarified once. 

0:25:16.720 --> 0:25:17.670 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:25:22.620 --> 0:25:22.800 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:25:16.540 --> 0:25:25.330 
Martin clay 
So they know that is actually a good uh, you know, point that the Karthik brought up because then that's why I wanted to have all this discussion really out and clear. 

0:25:29.270 --> 0:25:29.470 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:25:25.340 --> 0:25:30.810 
Martin clay 
I don't want to go through the notebooks and show you all that, but and the approach also right. 

0:25:36.740 --> 0:25:36.970 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:25:41.350 --> 0:25:41.570 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:25:44.180 --> 0:25:44.330 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:25:30.820 --> 0:25:44.860 
Martin clay 
As I said in the code itself, pipelining and parallel processing and threading, those kind of things we can put, but that would be better to have in the clean code where I know that you have to fix certain things and if there's team. 

0:25:46.180 --> 0:25:46.790 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:25:47.60 --> 0:25:47.490 
Tuhin 
So. 

0:25:47.980 --> 0:25:48.190 
Carl Droste 
Cool. 

0:25:47.560 --> 0:25:48.430 
Tuhin 
So Priyanka guy. 

0:25:45.20 --> 0:25:49.520 
Martin clay 
So this is a separate conversation then, hmm. 

0:25:48.440 --> 0:25:49.610 
Tuhin 
Yeah, Priyanka. 

0:25:49.620 --> 0:25:50.570 
Tuhin 
No, I understand it. 

0:25:51.460 --> 0:25:51.720 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:25:50.580 --> 0:25:56.830 
Tuhin 
Right, so here's here's the here's the here's how we need to lay it out right. 

0:25:57.160 --> 0:25:57.390 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:25:57.360 --> 0:26:6.710 
Tuhin 
So essentially right, you know, one level of thing is that, OK, we see like, you know, whatever you guys are talking about the CPU core, right? 

0:26:7.110 --> 0:26:7.340 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:26:7.0 --> 0:26:9.530 
Tuhin 
And Karthik seems like aligned with you guys, right? 

0:26:9.760 --> 0:26:13.750 
Tuhin 
So obviously we are incurring unnecessary things there, right? 

0:26:14.640 --> 0:26:14.910 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:26:13.760 --> 0:26:16.820 
Tuhin 
So that's the level of optimization right now. 

0:26:18.250 --> 0:26:24.120 
Tuhin 
Forget my French right, but if I go in there and I look at like, you know, how packed up our code is, right. 

0:26:24.340 --> 0:26:24.610 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:26:24.250 --> 0:26:30.80 
Tuhin 
And you say, like refactoring this, it's gonna take way too much time. 

0:26:30.170 --> 0:26:34.300 
Tuhin 
It's just better to take the requirements and like you know, rebuild the pipeline, right. 

0:26:34.410 --> 0:26:37.930 
Tuhin 
If that's the recommendation, that's the recommendation, right? 

0:26:38.580 --> 0:26:38.720 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:26:38.440 --> 0:26:50.670 
Tuhin 
And Matt might ask you ask you to like, you know, ask you pointed question like you really try to pressure you to you know make sure that you have thought through alternatives, right. 

0:26:51.480 --> 0:26:51.700 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:26:50.980 --> 0:27:4.510 
Tuhin 
But if your recommendation is sound and it's based on based on evidence, and if you ask his question and you can show reason AB and C why refactoring versus 0 to one is better, right? 

0:27:4.600 --> 0:27:4.910 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:27:5.480 --> 0:27:5.760 
Tuhin 
It's full. 

0:27:5.770 --> 0:27:7.160 
Tuhin 
Likely go zero to 1, right? 

0:27:7.170 --> 0:27:11.660 
Tuhin 
Because at the end of the day, our goal is to fix it faster, right? 

0:27:12.630 --> 0:27:12.760 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:27:11.670 --> 0:27:15.200 
Tuhin 
If zero to one is faster, that's why that's what we'll go with, yeah. 

0:27:16.30 --> 0:27:16.250 
Carl Droste 
So. 

0:27:13.990 --> 0:27:16.620 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, yeah, that was that. 

0:27:16.630 --> 0:27:18.840 
Karthik Raghu 
That's what I also told her to in in the afternoon. 

0:27:18.850 --> 0:27:19.200 
Karthik Raghu 
Right. 

0:27:18.380 --> 0:27:19.420 
Tuhin 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:27:22.70 --> 0:27:22.420 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:27:19.350 --> 0:27:23.210 
Karthik Raghu 
The goal is to fix things faster that you would decide like better. 

0:27:28.120 --> 0:27:28.290 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:27:23.300 --> 0:27:32.390 
Karthik Raghu 
Whether you know just starting from scratch is is the way to go because we already have some like she can take bits and pieces from. 

0:27:32.460 --> 0:27:34.220 
Karthik Raghu 
From whatever is existing, right? 

0:27:34.550 --> 0:27:34.710 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:27:42.810 --> 0:27:42.950 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:27:49.240 --> 0:27:49.460 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:27:52.520 --> 0:27:52.850 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:27:34.710 --> 0:27:54.390 
Karthik Raghu 
But it's just like, don't what I'm what I was asking is like, you know, you can take bits and pieces about from the existing code, but then don't try to modify the existing code, just shut off everything on the existing code and then just start a, you know, incorporating any new notebook that way, at least everybody will be confident. 

0:27:54.400 --> 0:27:54.590 
Karthik Raghu 
Right. 

0:27:55.140 --> 0:27:55.340 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:27:54.600 --> 0:27:55.410 
Karthik Raghu 
Like we are. 

0:27:56.20 --> 0:27:56.160 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:27:57.610 --> 0:27:57.770 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:27:59.660 --> 0:27:59.840 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:27:55.540 --> 0:28:1.450 
Karthik Raghu 
We know what we are doing and then these are the steps that we need to do and then this is how we have implemented right now. 

0:28:1.460 --> 0:28:3.500 
Karthik Raghu 
If you say like you know there's like this all messed up. 

0:28:5.510 --> 0:28:5.850 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:28:9.110 --> 0:28:9.250 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:28:3.510 --> 0:28:16.420 
Karthik Raghu 
I mean like, completely like, you know, we are not even able to figure out like, like to what extent we have done the progress and then what is pending like we we don't have that information. 

0:28:14.860 --> 0:28:16.990 
Tuhin 
Umm yeah. 

0:28:17.170 --> 0:28:19.460 
Karthik Raghu 
Maybe, maybe, maybe tomorrow. 

0:28:23.410 --> 0:28:23.670 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:28:19.470 --> 0:28:28.140 
Karthik Raghu 
Priyanka, when you have a call with the Tarang and Team right, maybe that these are the kind of kind of questions that you need to ask to make sure that you are comfortable. 

0:28:28.890 --> 0:28:31.500 
Karthik Raghu 
Ohh in in dealing with the code right? 

0:28:31.680 --> 0:28:31.880 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:28:32.20 --> 0:28:32.410 
Martin clay 
Shaun. 

0:28:40.500 --> 0:28:40.790 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:28:40.990 --> 0:28:41.380 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:28:31.590 --> 0:28:42.400 
Karthik Raghu 
Because otherwise you 22 is gonna come back to you and then say, hey, yeah, like, you know, you gave the recommendation and then you were supposed to look at the code without doing it, like, how can't you, how can you. 

0:28:42.410 --> 0:28:44.60 
Karthik Raghu 
That is what I think he's referring to. 

0:28:44.780 --> 0:28:45.40 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:28:44.610 --> 0:28:45.950 
Tuhin 
Right. Right, right. 

0:28:44.70 --> 0:28:46.730 
Karthik Raghu 
Like you know, just just thinking through the options, right? 

0:28:47.0 --> 0:28:47.430 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:28:47.500 --> 0:28:47.770 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:28:47.650 --> 0:28:48.330 
Martin clay 
Yeah, yeah, sure. 

0:28:47.820 --> 0:28:48.950 
Tuhin 
Essentially, Yep. 

0:28:49.60 --> 0:28:49.570 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:28:49.840 --> 0:28:51.750 
Tuhin 
So I think we're all aligned. 

0:28:51.940 --> 0:28:53.310 
Tuhin 
That makes sense. 

0:28:55.80 --> 0:28:55.340 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:28:53.600 --> 0:28:56.70 
Tuhin 
Priyanka and Rupali right. 

0:28:56.80 --> 0:28:56.950 
Tuhin 
You know, I don't know. 

0:28:56.960 --> 0:28:58.910 
Tuhin 
Like can we? 

0:29:8.220 --> 0:29:8.540 
Martin clay 
He is. 

0:28:59.120 --> 0:29:8.600 
Tuhin 
So this is good level of details and we need to have it, but I think we need to have a kind of like a reports and findings because it's been 2 weeks, right. 

0:29:8.890 --> 0:29:10.130 
Tuhin 
And I don't. 

0:29:10.290 --> 0:29:16.40 
Tuhin 
I don't want to Matt as this question, I want to preempt that right. 

0:29:16.50 --> 0:29:21.710 
Tuhin 
We need to present some findings to Matt and we need to get at a level higher abstracted for him, right? 

0:29:22.370 --> 0:29:22.640 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:29:22.700 --> 0:29:26.720 
Tuhin 
Is that something we can pull together for Friday for Matt, Matt to take a look at? 

0:29:24.950 --> 0:29:28.960 
Martin clay 
Yes, the definitely and that is the aim that we have. 

0:29:28.970 --> 0:29:29.200 
Martin clay 
Uh. 

0:29:29.630 --> 0:29:29.790 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:29:32.370 --> 0:29:32.530 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:29:29.210 --> 0:29:40.250 
Martin clay 
Wanted to bring all these, all the we have put all this in the you know, in the Monday Board but definitely from Friday we want to put it in the presentation and go very straight. 

0:29:40.190 --> 0:29:41.400 
Tuhin 
Mm-hmm. Right. 

0:29:40.260 --> 0:29:41.690 
Martin clay 
Point like this is the point. 

0:29:41.700 --> 0:29:42.310 
Martin clay 
This is the point. 

0:29:44.180 --> 0:29:44.360 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:29:42.320 --> 0:29:47.340 
Martin clay 
This is and and to also to the other point like for example. 

0:29:47.350 --> 0:29:51.230 
Martin clay 
Do you think these kind of points are what we went through when? 

0:29:50.330 --> 0:29:51.340 
Tuhin 
No, this is good. 

0:29:51.350 --> 0:29:58.700 
Tuhin 
This is good and he he so like, you know, maps maps sometime is very bottom up right. 

0:29:59.0 --> 0:29:59.220 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:29:59.250 --> 0:30:0.980 
Tuhin 
Sometimes it's top down, right? 

0:30:1.740 --> 0:30:1.970 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:30:0.990 --> 0:30:7.70 
Tuhin 
You know, it's it really depends on, you know, if he, if he has questions or not. Right. 

0:30:7.380 --> 0:30:7.760 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:30:7.270 --> 0:30:7.900 
Tuhin 
Because I'll. 

0:30:7.940 --> 0:30:8.980 
Tuhin 
I'll kind of tell you right. 

0:30:14.320 --> 0:30:14.570 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:30:8.990 --> 0:30:17.280 
Tuhin 
You know, I have done requirements review for him in very large thing where he just wanted to talk about strategic objectives, right. 

0:30:17.650 --> 0:30:17.880 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:30:23.970 --> 0:30:24.320 
Martin clay 
OK. 

0:30:17.430 --> 0:30:25.340 
Tuhin 
But sometimes I worked on very small things where he questioned about icons and then examples. Right? 

0:30:32.10 --> 0:30:32.260 
Martin clay 
Stop. 

0:30:25.470 --> 0:30:34.120 
Tuhin 
So so I think having this detail is important because we have to be prepared if he if the questions come from him, but then we can pull up the Monday. 

0:30:34.130 --> 0:30:38.240 
Tuhin 
But you know, we need to have like, you know something that we can run through in a meeting with. 

0:30:38.590 --> 0:30:38.760 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:30:38.980 --> 0:30:41.390 
Martin clay 
OK, I think all has something after that. 

0:30:41.400 --> 0:30:42.840 
Martin clay 
Either I have a point call. 

0:30:39.900 --> 0:30:43.130 
Tuhin 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

0:30:42.510 --> 0:30:43.480 
Carl Droste 
Yeah. 

0:30:59.720 --> 0:30:59.900 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:30:43.550 --> 0:31:4.150 
Carl Droste 
I just wanted to ask sounds the sound like there was a there's different, all these different regions, they're they're doing something different and you want to focus in on one seem like maybe you just focus in on US, let them play around with those other ones and then you just say don't touch the US we're going to refactor it and figure it out. 

0:31:4.400 --> 0:31:17.290 
Carl Droste 
And then once you get it the way you like it, then you say now we're just going to copy this to, you know, EU and AP and kind of keep the the craziness from happening. 

0:31:17.300 --> 0:31:20.620 
Carl Droste 
That's that's just my initial thought that I was hearing all this. 

0:31:20.670 --> 0:31:21.670 
Martin clay 
Agreed completely. 

0:31:23.110 --> 0:31:23.700 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:31:24.450 --> 0:31:24.600 
Martin clay 
And. 

0:31:23.790 --> 0:31:25.360 
Tuhin 
And the US might be a good thing, right? 

0:31:25.370 --> 0:31:27.180 
Tuhin 
Because US has larger volume, right? 

0:31:27.530 --> 0:31:38.210 
Tuhin 
So if we are looking at performance and like you know, long term sustainability of whatever we are changing, right, US might be a good spot that actually brings up a good point. 

0:31:38.220 --> 0:31:38.680 
Tuhin 
I'm just. 

0:31:38.690 --> 0:31:41.520 
Tuhin 
I know we are over time, so I'm just gonna quickly mention it, right. 

0:31:41.410 --> 0:31:41.680 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:31:43.550 --> 0:31:52.280 
Tuhin 
Is it fair to assume right in and I'm gonna make a stupid sample right when a front end developer and a back end developer works right in an application right? 

0:31:52.680 --> 0:31:52.930 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:31:52.830 --> 0:31:57.160 
Tuhin 
In order to work on currently right, they agree on an API contract, right? 

0:31:57.490 --> 0:31:57.800 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:31:57.440 --> 0:32:3.400 
Tuhin 
The front end developer says like back end developer ID you're gonna give me this API and you know these are going to be API. 

0:32:3.410 --> 0:32:5.400 
Tuhin 
You know, this is this is the response. 

0:32:6.440 --> 0:32:6.670 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:32:5.470 --> 0:32:14.960 
Tuhin 
This is whatever right is it fair to assume that that kind of contract exists between silver to bronze, bronze to whatever gold or no? 

0:32:18.680 --> 0:32:19.30 
Martin clay 
So. 

0:32:22.130 --> 0:32:22.330 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:32:19.40 --> 0:32:23.870 
Martin clay 
So I I'll try to answer and let me know if the this is what you like. 

0:32:26.320 --> 0:32:27.330 
Tuhin 
Sure, sure, fear. 

0:32:24.240 --> 0:32:28.170 
Martin clay 
Bronze is just the raw where you're getting everything bronze to silver. 

0:32:28.260 --> 0:32:37.500 
Martin clay 
It is not a API or a contract, but it is like OK silver is where I'll get all the clean the same data but clean data with as I mentioned the seven. 

0:32:39.460 --> 0:32:39.800 
Martin clay 
Is it? 

0:32:37.300 --> 0:32:41.90 
Tuhin 
But the schema the the there is a schema expectation between the two, right? 

0:32:46.70 --> 0:32:46.260 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:32:42.240 --> 0:32:47.870 
Martin clay 
It should be idly the same with everything, the data, the raw that we got was as it is. 

0:32:51.380 --> 0:32:51.630 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:32:48.0 --> 0:32:53.30 
Martin clay 
As you mentioned, some might be missing data or some might be duplicate and some some might have some other data. 

0:32:53.40 --> 0:32:59.750 
Martin clay 
Collect all the data quality issues generally in Data Lake between the raw and silver have to be resolved on the gold air. 

0:32:59.760 --> 0:33:1.940 
Martin clay 
Yes, that is expectation as you're mentioning. 

0:33:1.950 --> 0:33:12.820 
Martin clay 
So between silver and gold, all those calculations or what data should be coming and what at what calculation all that and that is where we create different data marts for different contracts, right? 

0:33:13.420 --> 0:33:13.620 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:33:13.170 --> 0:33:16.840 
Martin clay 
Like this API is going to use this, so this should be ready for them to fetch. 

0:33:17.650 --> 0:33:18.40 
Tuhin 
Right. 

0:33:23.400 --> 0:33:23.660 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:33:18.160 --> 0:33:27.770 
Tuhin 
OK, so the reason I'm kind of mentioning it right, because if we go the zero to 1 approach, right, we we may not be able to fix all three layers at the same time, right? 

0:33:27.860 --> 0:33:28.330 
Martin clay 
Definitely. 

0:33:27.780 --> 0:33:30.640 
Tuhin 
So does it make sense for us to explore layer by layer? 

0:33:31.690 --> 0:33:32.480 
Tuhin 
Right, that's why. 

0:33:32.530 --> 0:33:36.230 
Tuhin 
That's why I I went, went down this rabbit hole. Yeah. 

0:33:34.690 --> 0:33:44.220 
Martin clay 
Hmm, no, I think I am in the same page with you because right now what we are seeing by that will be a good approach is. 

0:33:45.850 --> 0:33:53.970 
Martin clay 
Taking from my sequel, because you have my sequel, whether you or the sequel in AWS, where you have the data, where is, it's not so desperate discrepancies, right? 

0:33:54.280 --> 0:33:54.480 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:33:54.110 --> 0:33:58.560 
Martin clay 
But because of 3/4 reasons reasons, different reasons, right? 

0:33:59.170 --> 0:33:59.370 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:33:58.990 --> 0:34:2.40 
Martin clay 
Yeah, I see that we started. 

0:34:2.50 --> 0:34:4.80 
Martin clay 
This is one example that I was going to state earlier. 

0:34:4.90 --> 0:34:10.360 
Martin clay 
Also one example is we were we went to the code and the comment that we got is that append is causing duplication. 

0:34:10.760 --> 0:34:10.980 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:34:11.70 --> 0:34:14.500 
Martin clay 
Uh, and I was a little concerned that append. 

0:34:23.160 --> 0:34:25.80 
Tuhin 
Umm, welcome. 

0:34:44.770 --> 0:34:45.30 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:34:14.510 --> 0:34:47.50 
Martin clay 
Why is it causing and we took it back and we took it into the lower environment and till now we are not able to duplicate that because of the append the code and then we see this concurrent jobs running and then stopping and then failing and we doubt that that so it'll be better to 1st cause remove all these causes and obviously the performance from my here bronze layer becomes more important is because 45 minutes of one hour and 5 minutes is taken by the consumption of the layer from bronze from my SQL to bronze right? 

0:34:47.270 --> 0:34:47.450 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:34:47.990 --> 0:34:50.720 
Martin clay 
That that should reduce a lot of things. 

0:34:50.730 --> 0:34:53.880 
Martin clay 
And so that should at least not introduce any. 

0:34:59.170 --> 0:35:0.240 
Tuhin 
Umm yeah. 

0:34:54.130 --> 0:35:2.380 
Martin clay 
Right now we are seeing that the data quality is it issues are being introduced by the bronze layer and then removed in the silver layer. 

0:35:2.590 --> 0:35:4.580 
Martin clay 
At least we want to have a clean layer there. 

0:35:5.80 --> 0:35:5.330 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:35:4.590 --> 0:35:6.900 
Martin clay 
It should be exact copy of my SQL right? 

0:35:6.910 --> 0:35:7.640 
Martin clay 
Or your SQL. 

0:35:7.390 --> 0:35:7.860 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:35:8.70 --> 0:35:8.570 
Martin clay 
That's it. 

0:35:8.210 --> 0:35:10.740 
Tuhin 
So so Priyanka that's that's what I'm coming at. 

0:35:10.750 --> 0:35:14.230 
Tuhin 
I'm sorry we're a little bit overtime and we can stop the call soon, right? 

0:35:14.230 --> 0:35:15.210 
Martin clay 
No issues, no issues. 

0:35:14.850 --> 0:35:19.510 
Tuhin 
The so I'm just saying like, you know exactly as you are saying, right? 

0:35:19.590 --> 0:35:20.710 
Tuhin 
So you are saying right? 

0:35:20.720 --> 0:35:25.510 
Tuhin 
That's why I was kind of saying like, you know, does the data have to be any different or whatever, right. 

0:35:25.800 --> 0:35:30.50 
Tuhin 
So we optimize my SQL to databricks right? 

0:35:32.370 --> 0:35:32.670 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:35:30.60 --> 0:35:34.330 
Tuhin 
That ingestion right, and that's one thing optimization we do right. 

0:35:34.340 --> 0:35:39.550 
Tuhin 
And if we don't change, in my opinion, right, if we don't change the schema or whatever, right. 

0:35:39.920 --> 0:35:43.710 
Tuhin 
And we're just doing it better than that part is solved, right? 

0:35:43.900 --> 0:35:44.30 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:35:44.160 --> 0:35:45.190 
Tuhin 
That's kind of right. 

0:35:45.200 --> 0:35:47.350 
Tuhin 
Then then we move on to the next problem. Right. 

0:35:47.500 --> 0:35:51.590 
Tuhin 
Kind of like solve the problem step by step, right? 

0:35:56.80 --> 0:35:57.670 
Martin clay 
Yes, yes. 

0:35:51.600 --> 0:35:58.240 
Tuhin 
So then you know it can also be put into practice sooner that that's what I'm getting at, OK. 

0:35:57.840 --> 0:36:1.930 
Martin clay 
And that is one reason of bringing all this here and only looking taking. 

0:36:1.910 --> 0:36:2.130 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:36:9.740 --> 0:36:9.870 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:36:2.220 --> 0:36:11.70 
Martin clay 
I can look at reporting and all and go back, but I'm looking at this because I see we can if we can have that clean layer because there's a saying in data, right? 

0:36:11.360 --> 0:36:12.450 
Martin clay 
Garbage in, garbage out. 

0:36:12.960 --> 0:36:13.920 
Tuhin 
Yes. Yeah. 

0:36:14.10 --> 0:36:17.280 
Martin clay 
That garbage in at least we have to stop first, right? 

0:36:17.50 --> 0:36:17.310 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:36:17.670 --> 0:36:18.80 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:36:18.210 --> 0:36:21.560 
Martin clay 
So no one thing that Tuhin I'm I'm. 

0:36:21.570 --> 0:36:23.160 
Martin clay 
No, I'm talking to another point. 

0:36:23.170 --> 0:36:31.0 
Martin clay 
I just remembered we for the current scenario because you are having those compute running and you are having those jobs failing. 

0:36:32.150 --> 0:36:35.60 
Martin clay 
Anyway, they're running after one hour, 5 minutes on an average right? 

0:36:35.210 --> 0:36:40.200 
Martin clay 
Can we reschedule them from, you know, in that so that at least you have less failures? 

0:36:41.510 --> 0:36:42.580 
Tuhin 
Say that one more time. 

0:36:42.590 --> 0:36:45.100 
Tuhin 
I didn't understand the question, yeah. 

0:36:47.250 --> 0:36:50.30 
Tuhin 
Yeah, the ingestion job. 

0:36:53.900 --> 0:36:54.140 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:36:43.240 --> 0:36:55.130 
Martin clay 
The ingestion right, the jobs that are running on production right now, they are failing and because they are starting before the one job entire job right there with task, both of them right. 

0:36:55.520 --> 0:36:58.230 
Martin clay 
So what is happening is they are failing as soon as they start. 

0:37:1.650 --> 0:37:2.520 
Tuhin 
Why are they feeling? 

0:37:2.530 --> 0:37:5.160 
Tuhin 
Because the other other one didn't finish or what? 

0:36:58.240 --> 0:37:5.340 
Martin clay 
So you have concurrent run fails and then in an hour or two then the other job, the van starts. 

0:37:5.670 --> 0:37:6.150 
Martin clay 
Yeah. 

0:37:6.260 --> 0:37:8.350 
Tuhin 
OK, yeah. 

0:37:6.160 --> 0:37:11.90 
Martin clay 
The other one did not start and then it keeps trying to because it's scheduled every one minute. 

0:37:11.580 --> 0:37:11.780 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:37:12.500 --> 0:37:22.160 
Martin clay 
So that they are constantly trying to bring up resources and consume and then it fails at least that we can clean that up and schedule. 

0:37:21.150 --> 0:37:24.760 
Tuhin 
Ohh so like that that the job itself doesn't like. 

0:37:26.130 --> 0:37:26.620 
Martin clay 
Hmm. 

0:37:24.770 --> 0:37:31.170 
Tuhin 
Let's say finish for 15 minutes, but it's trying for 14 times to kick off another. OK. 

0:37:27.210 --> 0:37:31.870 
Martin clay 
Yes, I yes, I can. 

0:37:32.0 --> 0:37:33.850 
Martin clay 
I that's why I opened this. 

0:37:33.940 --> 0:37:36.310 
Martin clay 
Yet if you see this so if. 

0:37:35.50 --> 0:37:38.40 
Tuhin 
Well, you know, I think I think that should be a no brainer, right? 

0:37:38.450 --> 0:37:38.570 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:37:38.50 --> 0:37:42.260 
Tuhin 
You know, if my job if my job takes 15 minutes to complete, right? 

0:37:42.270 --> 0:37:44.400 
Tuhin 
Why am I gonna start to try it? 

0:37:44.490 --> 0:37:46.790 
Tuhin 
Try to start it 14 other times, right? 

0:37:47.490 --> 0:37:47.620 
Martin clay 
Yes. 

0:37:47.540 --> 0:37:54.670 
Tuhin 
Yeah, I mean I I, is it gonna have any like a quality like, you know any measurable impact, right. 

0:37:54.680 --> 0:37:57.530 
Tuhin 
You know, is it gonna lower my price or it doesn't matter? 

0:37:58.120 --> 0:38:0.520 
Tuhin 
Sorry, sorry to come back to the money point, but. 

0:37:58.380 --> 0:38:3.170 
Martin clay 
Umm yeah, no, I was also actually I was also thinking about that. 

0:38:3.310 --> 0:38:3.580 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:38:7.0 --> 0:38:7.220 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:38:3.420 --> 0:38:8.10 
Martin clay 
But as I said, the configurations that are in this such a way that I'm not sure. 

0:38:8.530 --> 0:38:9.240 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:38:9.310 --> 0:38:10.890 
Tuhin 
OK. OK. 

0:38:8.20 --> 0:38:15.900 
Martin clay 
I'm hoping that will do it for you, at least by you can start with one set this that is not going to impact anything and maybe bring some Costa. 

0:38:14.650 --> 0:38:19.10 
Tuhin 
Hey, if it's gonna Priyanka, if it's gonna save me 100 bucks, that's a win, right? 

0:38:19.20 --> 0:38:19.570 
Tuhin 
But you know. 

0:38:25.720 --> 0:38:26.680 
Tuhin 
So and it. 

0:38:20.70 --> 0:38:26.990 
Martin clay 
That definitely I I I'm sure that was more than that, baby, because this is running every minute. 

0:38:26.960 --> 0:38:28.530 
Tuhin 
Yeah. Yeah, OK. 

0:38:28.580 --> 0:38:29.50 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:38:29.300 --> 0:38:30.910 
Tuhin 
Yeah, let's try to figure that out. 

0:38:28.460 --> 0:38:31.210 
Martin clay 
So I hope that that brings you something. 

0:38:30.920 --> 0:38:32.410 
Tuhin 
Let's try to figure that out. 

0:38:32.460 --> 0:38:32.950 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:38:33.220 --> 0:38:34.940 
Tuhin 
Yeah, OK. Alright. 

0:38:34.330 --> 0:38:37.660 
Martin clay 
So so I I brought that up because that is a business question, right? 

0:38:37.900 --> 0:38:38.170 
Tuhin 
Right. 

0:38:37.670 --> 0:38:38.390 
Martin clay 
And I wouldn't. 

0:38:38.180 --> 0:38:39.580 
Tuhin 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:38:38.400 --> 0:38:40.420 
Martin clay 
The schedule I wanted to check with. 

0:38:39.590 --> 0:38:41.740 
Tuhin 
I mean it's it's not even a question, right? 

0:38:41.750 --> 0:38:43.760 
Tuhin 
I don't think there is a Plan B, right? 

0:38:43.480 --> 0:38:44.680 
Martin clay 
I know, yeah. 

0:38:43.770 --> 0:38:45.840 
Tuhin 
You're saying it's not gonna finish, right? 

0:38:45.850 --> 0:38:51.70 
Tuhin 
And it's a kind of like a moot point at that time, right, so yes. 

0:38:47.870 --> 0:38:54.480 
Martin clay 
Yeah, the yes, but it's my job to ask exactly. 

0:38:53.440 --> 0:38:56.380 
Tuhin 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

0:38:51.540 --> 0:38:56.550 
Carl Droste 
Just wasting resources is all it's doing chewing CPU time this big waste. 

0:38:56.580 --> 0:38:58.270 
Martin clay 
So are you exactly in the? 

0:38:58.340 --> 0:39:0.630 
Martin clay 
Maybe that'll at least reduce 2-3 minutes. 

0:39:4.110 --> 0:39:4.280 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:39:6.910 --> 0:39:7.150 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:39:0.640 --> 0:39:7.890 
Martin clay 
Also of your job that is trying to get somewhere else, right and later we can have concurrent runs with the concurrent code. Right? 

0:39:9.170 --> 0:39:9.430 
Carl Droste 
Yep. 

0:39:10.850 --> 0:39:11.420 
Tuhin 
That's fair. 

0:39:11.490 --> 0:39:12.410 
Tuhin 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

0:39:8.540 --> 0:39:12.520 
Martin clay 
OK, so so that is maybe Karthik to we can do that. 

0:39:12.420 --> 0:39:13.660 
Tuhin 
And Karthik can figure that out. 

0:39:13.670 --> 0:39:13.910 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:39:13.920 --> 0:39:14.890 
Tuhin 
Yeah, that's OK. Yeah. 

0:39:15.870 --> 0:39:16.980 
Martin clay 
So OK. 

0:39:16.960 --> 0:39:17.200 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:39:17.960 --> 0:39:21.870 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, I think Tuhin tomorrow we'll again sync up like together. 

0:39:21.490 --> 0:39:22.430 
Tuhin 
Yes. Yep. 

0:39:21.880 --> 0:39:22.870 
Karthik Raghu 
And then what? 

0:39:28.580 --> 0:39:28.810 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:39:22.880 --> 0:39:35.30 
Karthik Raghu 
We're gonna do is like we're gonna just, first of all optimize the size of the server and then what's he gonna do is like, she's gonna try to see if she can optimize the any of the configurations. 

0:39:35.540 --> 0:39:35.700 
Tuhin 
Yep. 

0:39:35.540 --> 0:39:36.870 
Karthik Raghu 
That is where she'll start. 

0:39:43.730 --> 0:39:43.900 
Tuhin 
Umm. 

0:39:48.970 --> 0:39:49.130 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:39:38.120 --> 0:39:49.470 
Karthik Raghu 
Maybe I think once I'm thinking like Priyanka speaks to Tarang and team, then I think she'll have an idea about why the code is, you know everywhere like you know why? 

0:39:49.480 --> 0:39:52.390 
Karthik Raghu 
Why it's not matching with any environment and then why it is? 

0:39:52.780 --> 0:39:54.270 
Karthik Raghu 
Why those discrepancies? Right? 

0:39:54.910 --> 0:39:56.830 
Tuhin 
Yep, yeah. 

0:39:54.280 --> 0:40:3.120 
Karthik Raghu 
Let let her get clarity on that, but meanwhile to immediate as immediate measure, at least, we are just planning to reduce the size of the server. 

0:40:4.110 --> 0:40:4.310 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:40:3.520 --> 0:40:9.160 
Karthik Raghu 
Ohh you something you know which is which is being used at least. 

0:40:10.70 --> 0:40:11.570 
Tuhin 
Yeah. OK. 

0:40:11.710 --> 0:40:12.60 
Karthik Raghu 
Don't. 

0:40:12.370 --> 0:40:13.670 
Karthik Raghu 
We will not overprovisioning. 

0:40:25.270 --> 0:40:25.870 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:40:12.170 --> 0:40:27.440 
Martin clay 
The one thing or more I think, yeah, I think we'll have to get that wrong in Tarang also into pride because scheduling is something that he has done and he might be watching it because some of the times he said that the job doesn't take the data and he runs in notebook. 

0:40:25.940 --> 0:40:29.570 
Tuhin 
I mean, he's not watching it right because it's failing right now. 

0:40:30.80 --> 0:40:30.910 
Tuhin 
Like you know, we should have. 

0:40:31.780 --> 0:40:32.190 
Tuhin 
Yeah. 

0:40:32.130 --> 0:40:34.310 
Martin clay 
OK, OK. 

0:40:32.200 --> 0:40:34.660 
Tuhin 
Anyways, OK, alright, now sounds good. 

0:40:34.320 --> 0:40:35.0 
Martin clay 
Yeah. OK. 

0:40:34.730 --> 0:40:35.700 
Tuhin 
OK. Sounds good. 

0:40:35.710 --> 0:40:37.30 
Tuhin 
Yeah, like, but yeah. 

0:40:37.180 --> 0:40:38.510 
Tuhin 
Yeah, please do connect. 

0:40:39.200 --> 0:40:39.420 
Martin clay 
Umm. 

0:40:50.820 --> 0:40:52.510 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, sure, yeah. 

0:40:58.670 --> 0:40:58.790 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah. 

0:40:38.520 --> 0:41:0.540 
Tuhin 
But you know then you guys, Karthik writing you know please like you know if it makes sense Karthick please just go ahead and like you know tell the team to like you know to certain things like you know let's not get into like back and forth right, you just Give your opinion in terms of what makes sense for infra right and you tell them it is what it is and ask them to live with it. 

0:41:0.980 --> 0:41:1.390 
Karthik Raghu 
OK. 

0:41:1.320 --> 0:41:2.70 
Tuhin 
Yeah. Yeah. 

0:41:1.900 --> 0:41:2.630 
Karthik Raghu 
Yeah, yeah, sure. 

0:41:2.640 --> 0:41:3.900 
Karthik Raghu 
Sure, I'll coordinate that, yeah. 

0:41:4.240 --> 0:41:5.10 
Tuhin 
Alright, sounds good. 

0:41:5.20 --> 0:41:5.340 
Tuhin 
Thank you. 

0:41:5.350 --> 0:41:5.630 
Tuhin 
OK. 

0:41:5.640 --> 0:41:8.370
